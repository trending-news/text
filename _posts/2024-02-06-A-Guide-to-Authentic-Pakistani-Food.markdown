## Introduction
Pakistani cuisine is influenced by Persian, Indian and Middle Eastern cooking traditions. Home to a wide range of regional cuisines, Pakistan has a long culinary history spanning over centuries. In this guide, we will introduce some classic Pakistani dishes ranging from street foods to curries, breads, kebabs and desserts.
## Street Food Snacks
### Gol Gappay
Gol gappay, also known as pani puri, are a popular street food snack in Pakistan. Thin, crisp pastry shells are deep fried and then stuffed with a mixture of potatoes, chickpeas, tamarind and spicy chutneys before popping into your mouth in one go. The explosion of flavors from the shells and filling cools down delightfully with each sip of refreshingly tangy "pani".

### Shami Kababs
Traditionally made from beef or lamb, shami kababs are lentil and meat patties that melt deliciously in your mouth. Ground meat is blended with lentils, onions and a mix of aromatic spices before shaping and frying the patties. Paired with grilled bread, shami kababs make for hearty street snack any time of the day.
## Regional Specialties
### Gilgit-Baltistan Cuisine
Located in the northern mountains of Pakistan, Gilgit-Baltistan is renowned for its unique culinary traditions. Apricots thrive in the temperate climate and mamtu, a jam-like apricot juice, quenches thirst throughout summers. Chamus dried fruits including apricots, mulberries and walnuts are a specialty too.
### Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Dishes
The northwestern province is famous for its chapli kababs - minced meat patties flavored with cumin and coriander. Peshawari chicken tikka, marinated in thick creamy yogurt and spices, is another star. Roasted over charcoal, the tender morsels melt in the mouth.
## Curries and Rice Dishes
### Chicken Karahi
A signature Pakistani curry, chicken karahi simmers tomatoes, onions and a hot, spice-packed gravy with fall-off-the-bone chicken pieces. Garnished with fresh cilantro, a bowl of chicken karahi over rice is comfort in a dish.
### Nihari
A stew originally from the city of Lahore, nihari is comfort cooking at its finest. Tender boneless meat simmers overnight in a rich, ginger-spice broth. Its complexity only increases the longer it cooks. Nihari is best enjoyed with naan or rice on a cold winter morning.
### Biryani
Saffron-scented basmati rice is layered with a protein like chicken or lamb along with dried fruits and nuts. As it bakes under a sealed lid, flavors mingle to create a fragrant pilaf. There are many regional variations of this signature rice dish.
## Bread Baking
### Naan
Still baked fresh in tandoor (clay) ovens, naan is a classic leavened flatbread. Thin and puffed, it pairs perfectly with curries to soak up every last drop of flavorful gravy.
### Khamiri Roti
A richer naan, khamiri roti contains yeast and maida flour for a lighter, fluffier texture. Its delicate structure makes it ideal for wraps.
### Paratha
A staple breakfast flatbread, multilayered paratha is crafted by rubbing dough between the palms and frying each layer to a crisp, flaky golden-brown. Great with tea or curd.
## Kebabs
### Seekh Kabab
Minced meat is seasoned with spices then grilled on skewers over charcoal. The smoky kababs impart intense grill flavor with each bite.
### Chapli Kabab
Bursting with flavors, these patties contain a minced meat paste blended with tomatoes, green chilies and aromatic masalas. Grilled to perfection.
### Tikka Kabab
Tender chicken or meat marinated for hours in a thick creamy yogurt-spice mixture before being roasted to juicy tender morsels.
## Soups and Stews
### Haleem
A beloved winter stew, haleem simmers wheatberries, lentils and lamb in a broth spiced with ginger, cinnamon and cardamom. Soft, flavorful and comforting.
### Nihari Soup
Similar to the nihari stew, this soup uses the long-cooked, fall-off-the-bone beef or lamb shanks in a broth spiked with caramelized onions, garlic and warming spices.
### Paya Soup
Featuring smoked lamb trotters (feet), this hearty soup derives intense meaty flavors from the bone marrow. A true soul-food remedy.
## Sweets
### Jalebi
Bright orange funnel-shaped fritters are deep fried in a besan-rice flour batter then soaked in sweet syrup infused with cardamom and saffron. Light yet decadent.
### Kulfis
Pakistan's version of frozen dairy desserts, kulfis are prepared by reducing milk solids until thick then packing the mixture into earthenware pots to harden. Pistachios, almonds and seasonal fruits are common flavorings.
### Halwa
A sweet pudding made from semolina, vegetables, fruits or wheat, halwa can be enjoyed as is or with kulfis, jalebis or sheer khurma on festive occasions.
## Beverages
### Lassi
Whether savory with a pinch of salt or sweetened with sugar, this refreshing yogurt drink cools the body on a hot day. Rose petal or mango lassi options exist too.
### Sharbat
Cooling cordials are made by steeping fresh seasonal fruits like mango or carrot in water with sugar. Great for quenching thirst and keeping hydrated.
### Green Tea
Brewed dark and strong, green tea with mint and pistachios is a favorite across Pakistan and great any time of day. Its comforting aroma and health properties make it beloved.
I hope this comprehensive guide provided a taste of the diverse and flavorful cuisine Pakistan has to offer. With regional specialties, curries, breads and desserts, every meal in Pakistan is an experience to remember.
