## Introduction
Sony introduced two versions of the PlayStation 5 (PS5) consoleâ€”a disc edition that can play both physical discs and digital games downloaded from the PlayStation Store, and an all-digital edition that is restricted to digital games purchased from the store. This article compares the key differences between the two editions to help readers decide which fits their gaming needs better. Factors to consider include game library options, upfront costs, potential savings over time, internet connectivity requirements, and how each edition might hold up years down the road.
### Game Library Options  
The disc edition has the widest range of compatibility with both physical discs and digital games. It provides flexibility to build a library from cheap used discs purchased physically or downloaded digitally. However, the digital edition is limited to digital games only from the PlayStation Store. Some game publishers may offer exclusive extra content on the physical disc version not available for the digital download.

### Initial Costs and Potential Savings
While the disc edition has a $100 higher list price of $499 compared to $399 for the digital edition, buying pre-owned physical discs can offset this gap over the long run for disc edition owners. Studies show disc users can recover the higher upfront cost within the first 1-2 years of regular gaming from savings on cheaper used discs. Gamers who prefer new releases are likely to benefit more from the disc edition's potential for long-term cost savings recouping the premium cost.
### Internet Connectivity Requirements  
One key difference is the internet dependence of each console. Digital games require a constant internet connection to play since games are downloaded digitally. In contrast, once installed, disc games can still be played separately without an internet connection, which provides more flexibility for gamers in remote areas with unreliable internet or data caps on their home broadband.
### Resale and Sharing Options
A unique advantage of the disc edition is the ability to resell, lend, or gift physical games to others once finished, allowing some cost recovery. However, digital games licenses are locked to the gamer's PlayStation Network account without any option for transferring ownership. The disc edition offers more control over one's game library and ability to recoup value after enjoying the games individually.
### Future-Proofing the Console
Because the PS5 is expected to have a lifespan of at least 5-7 years of support from Sony, a key consideration is how reliant on online services each console will be years into the future. While the PlayStation Store will likely continue offering past digital purchases, it is uncertain if the full back catalogue will remain available that far down the line if Sony refreshes its online services. However, disc games can still be played without any reliance on the PlayStation Network in the years ahead, making that option more future-proof for the long haul.
In summary, the disc edition of the PS5 provides more flexibility and options in game library access and control, greater potential for cost-savings, less reliance on a steady internet connection, and a higher likelihood of future-proofing one's game library far into the console's lifespan. For these reasons, unless budget and digital-only gaming are top priorities, the disc edition may be the better fit for most gamers and their evolving needs over several years of owning a PS5.
