### Advantages of emulators 
Emulators provide many conveniences over original hardware. They allow upscaling games to higher resolutions for improved visuals on modern displays. Save states enable pausing gameplay and resuming from the exact point, removing frustration from repeated deaths. Controller mapping gives flexibility to use any input device rather than being limited to original controllers. Overall, emulators make retro titles more accessible.

### Accuracy of early system emulation
Emulation of older 8-bit and 16-bit consoles like the NES, SNES, and Genesis is quite mature. With their relatively simple CPU and graphics chips, these systems can be replicated accurately on modern PCs. Projects like Higan focus exclusively on precision, even modeling minor quirks, so gamers get experiences identical to the original hardware. Newer systems present more challenges but emulation continues advancing.
### Popular emulator performance 
ZNES was once the leading choice but development stagnated as its creator moved on. It remains lightweight and performs well yet newer forks have introduced bugs. Snes9x maintains good compatibility and performance while providing plentiful options. Its simple GUI makes it straightforward for casual users. Higan prioritizes authenticity, which most won't notice, over raw speed. Performance mostly satisfies but remains less optimized than its competition.
### Alternative platforms
RetroArch serves as a one-stop shop by including emulators for dozens of consoles. It supports a wide variety of platforms from laptops to smartphones. The Raspberry Pi competently powers through 16-bit era games but strains with 3D titles. Modded original Xbox provides capable emulation on respectable internals and component video for a crisp presentation. Both small devices show promise as dedicated retro machines.   
### Save states vs nostalgia
Save states grant freedom from limitations of antiquated saving systems. Yet purists argue they undermine the challenge and risk that built suspense. However, spending excessive time replaying identical sections grows tedious and feels like an artificial hurdle rather than a meaningful test of skill. While nostalgia encourages purism, moderation maintains enjoyment without sacrificing too much authenticity.
### Display options
Emulators empower customizing displays beyond what hardware permitted. Upscaling pixel art using techniques like bilinear filtering presents assets clearly on HDTVs without altering their visual style. Non-native aspect ratios fill screens appropriately. Configurable shader presets like CRT Royale authentically simulate curved tube displays. These options make games visually appealing without emulating outdated technical restrictions.
### Controller flexibility 
Emulators let using any input devices rather than restricting to original limited selection. Experienced gamers with long gaming backgrounds may prefer adaptable controllers like the Xbox pad. Its familiar layout simplifies intricate tasks. Pioneering purists insisting on authenticity can stick to proper peripherals yet choice benefits everyone. And hybrid controllers merge modern ergonomics with strategic layouts. 
### Game selection
Emulators provide access to entire libraries comprising thousands of titles across many systems. Especially for hardware with only small built-in selections like Saturn or TurboGrafx, emulation represents the sole way of appreciating their vast offerings. And importing international cartridges or discs poses challenges. Simply installing expansive collections onto a PC bypasses regional restrictions and hardware shortages for unified retro experiences.
### Legality concerns
While emulators themselves operate in a gray area, downloading copyrighted ROM files breaches intellectual property. Although abandoned software faces unclear classification, safe practices involve using owned backups of discs or purchases from digital storefronts. With retro scenes reviving through online communities and dedicated re-releases, respecting original creators maintains thriving classic gaming cultures for future generations.
### Conclusion 
Overall emulation enhances retrospection of gaming history. It balances authenticity and accessibility, allowing customized, flexible experiences of enormous libraries across different devices. While nostalgia sparks debates, practicality and legality issues require reasonable compromise. Emulators breathe new life into classics, share gaming roots with younger fans, and honor developers' works through legal awareness and supporting official remasters. Both emulation and original hardware have merits, so choice rightfully rests with individual preferences.
