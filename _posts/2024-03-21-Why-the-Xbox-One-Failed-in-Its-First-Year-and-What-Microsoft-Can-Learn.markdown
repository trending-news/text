### Microsoft Overestimated Their Lead
Microsoft entered the next console generation overconfident after the success of the Xbox 360. They believed they had built up such a strong lead over Sony that the Xbox One launch would be simple. However, Microsoft focused too much on non-gaming features like the TV integration during their E3 2013 presentation. They failed to realize gamers primarily care about great games above all else. This overconfidence led them to overlook the need to clearly communicate their gaming vision and showcase exciting new titles.

### Bundled Kinect Increased Costs
While motion controls like Kinect appealed to some, most hardcore gamers saw it as unnecessary add-on driving up the price. With Kinect bundled in, the Xbox One launched at $100 more than the PS4. Despite claims Kinect expanded the available audience, the added expense discouraged potential customers. Many felt the machine itself should be affordable before thinking of extras. This pricing turned away customers who just wanted to play games without an expensive peripheral driving up the total package cost. 
### Restrictive DRM Policies Alienated Customers
On top of the higher price, Microsoft's initially planned restrictive digital rights management and online requirements truly upset gamers. Requiring an always-online connection and blocking the resale of used games went too far for most. This hurt Microsoft's relationship with retailers as well. While the policies were later reversed after immense criticism, the damage was already done for those early adopters Microsoft needed to attract. Many had already sworn off the platform and purchased a PS4 instead due to these customer-unfriendly restrictions.
### PlayStation 4 Outpaced Xbox One Sales
Sony capitalized heavily on Microsoft's blunders. With a lower price, focus on games, and no DRM blocks, the PS4 simply offered more value for core gamers. It outsold the Xbox One nearly 2:1 globally in the first year as a result. Lesser Xbox One sales meant Microsoft had less leverage getting priority for multiplatform games and DLC. Developers followed the larger install base on Sony's platform instead. This made the Xbox One library feel less robust, further exacerbating sales differences between the consoles.
### First Party Games Did Not Drive Interest
While PlayStation scored big with system sellers like God of War and Uncharted, Microsoft lacked must-have exclusives of their own early on. Games such as Ryse and Dead Rising 3 reviewed well enough but did little to excite long-time fans or move hardware off shelves. More memorable new franchises or seques to system carryover hits from the 360 were sorely missing from the Xbox One launch window. Without differentiation or exclusives people really wanted to play, Windows lacked compelling reasons for ownership over the rival platform.
### International Markets Preferred PlayStation 
Outside of core Western regions, the PlayStation brand had far more purchase power. Sony's platform dominated worldwide sales from the very start. Xbox struggled to gain ground in Asian and European countries where console gaming was mostly synonymous with PlayStation. Cultural differences made the Xbox proposition tougher to sell abroad without localized content or key local developer relationships. Failure to break into these critical non-US markets significantly hampered Xbox One's potential install base growth early on.
### Rebuilt Goodwill Through Changed Stance
To be fair, Microsoft did attempt course corrections after the missteps of 2013. They ultimately reversed the controversial DRM policies and dropped the Kinect bundle to reduce costs. Over time, exclusives like Halo and Gears saw new life while future iterations showed greater focus on gameplay. Still, the damage to mindshare remained substantial. Rebuilding goodwill requires more than policy changes - Microsoft must earn back trust through consistent consumer-first decisions and a steady stream of beloved exclusive software. Only then can they regain their footing for the next generation.
In summary, Microsoft's overconfidence, higher price point, and anti-consumer policies soured customers in a major way during the Xbox One launch period. While work continues, lessons on prioritizing games, affordability, and player freedom must stay at the forefront to avoid repeating past mistakes going forward. Continued investment in compelling exclusives tailored for both Western audiences and global markets alike will also be paramount to winning back consumer faith.
