## I. Introduction 
This guide aims to help new players understand and enjoy Resident Evil 2. With over 20 years since its original release, many people are experiencing this survival horror classic for the first time thanks to the 2019 remake. Whether you played the original or not, this guide breaks down the key story elements, gameplay mechanics, tips and more to get you up to speed on Raccoon City's outbreak.
### The Beginnig of the Outbreak
Resident Evil 2 takes place shortly after the events of the first game in Raccoon City. The zombie outbreak has overtaken the once prosperous midwestern town. Players choose to take control of either Leon S. Kennedy or Claire Redfield as they attempt to escape the city during the initial outbreak. Both characters are unfamiliar with what's happening and must work to understand the source of the infection while surviving relentless attacks from the undead.

## II. Overview of the Story
### A Tale of Two Characters 
The story differs slightly depending on which character is chosen but they intersect at various points. Leon is a new police officer on his first day just trying to grasp the dire situation. Claire is searching for her missing brother Chris and joins forces with Leon at times. Both encounter other playable characters like Sherry Birkin who holds secrets vital to stopping the viral outbreak. Piece by piece they work to uncover the plot of the nefarious Umbrella Corporation and stay alive long enough to escape the city.
## III. Main Characters
### Leon and Claire Lead the Way
Players will grow to love or hate the protagonists Leon and Claire depending on which scenario they choose. Leon relies on his police training despite being raw, while Claire acts on bravery and instincts. Both are thrust into adverse situations far outside their scope of experience. They'll make connections with other major characters like the sinister Mr. X tyrant or child victim Sherry along the journey. Getting to see events through different perspectives adds significant replay value.
## IV. Gameplay Basics 
###Survival at its Core
At its heart, Resident Evil 2 is a survival horror game. Players must carefully manage limited resources like healing items and ammunition against relentless enemies. Exploration is encouraged to find keys, unlock new areas and progress the plot. Combat relies on timing shots and dodging attacks rather than run and gun gameplay. Saving ammo is crucial - knife fights or avoiding enemies is sometimes safer. Mapping the precinct and sewers helps with navigation. With tense atmosphere and resource scarcity, survival is never guaranteed.
## V. Tips for Playing
###Maximizing Your Chances
Some tips for new players - search everywhere as every item could save your life. Conserve ammo for tougher enemies and bosses. Knife fights can work too. Combine herbs to make stronger medicines. Read all files and notes for story clues. Don't get grabbed - it's instant death. Board up windows to prepare safer rooms. Draw enemies toward each other to take them out more easily. And above all, keep moving and don't get pinned down by Mr. X!
## VI. Differences Between Scenarios
###New Perspectives to Discover 
Playing both scenarios is recommended for the full story. While route A with Leon has more focus on police station exploration and route B with Claire emphasizes the sewers more, there are distinct differences. Items, puzzles and enemy placement change between campaigns. Certain characters and plot points are only experienced from one side. And the true ending requires completion of both routes. Fans still uncover new details years later thanks to these perspective shifts that enhance subsequent replay value.
## VII. Unlocking Additional Content  
###Rewards for Mastery
For those seeking even more content, additional modes can be unlocked by meeting certain requirements. "The 4th Survivor" plays as a secret character with their own scenario. "The Tofu Survivor" is an absurd mini-game. And "The Ghost Survivors" adds three new survivor stories as downloadable content. Finishing under certain times or with S ranks unlocks Infinite Ammo, costumes and concept art galleries as well. This rewards players who achieve mastery over the game's challenges with exciting new ways to experience the outbreak.
## VIII. Essential Knowledge from Previous Games
###Understanding Umbrella's Threat 
While Resident Evil 2 stands well as a newcomer's starting point, there is valuable lore established in earlier titles. Resident Evil introduced the mansion incident and revealed Umbrella's experiments with the T-virus. Resident Evil 0 prequel filled in details on the origin of these viral weapons. Resident Evil 3 covered Jill Valentine's escape from Raccoon City and Nemesis battles. Fans who take in these backstories will appreciate more references and how each game builds upon Umbrella's atrocities. While not required, it enhances investment in the overarching universe.
## IX. What to Expect in Future Titles 
###The Saga Marches On
Capcom has continued advancing the Resident Evil saga in many directions since the events of Raccoon City. Resident Evil 3 Remake just launched bringing new life to Jill's story. Resident Evil 7 shifted perspectives and RE8 will follow a new hero in a disturbing locale. The successful remakes have induced demand for Resident Evil Code Veronica and Resident Evil 4 overhauls as well. Plus, the franchise expanded with movies, novels and spin-offs. For those hooked on Raccoon City's outbreak, there's a rich mythology still growing across different developers keeping the survival horror exciting for decades more.
