## Nintendo 64 Capabilities
### Cutting Edge 3D Graphics
The Nintendo 64 launched in 1996 and was Nintendo's first 64-bit console. It was capable of displaying over 16 million colors from a 32-bit color palette. This marked a significant jump over the Super Nintendo's 512 color palette. The N64 utilized cartridges up to 64MB in size, which allowed some early 3D games but limited developers' ability to include high resolution textures and significantly larger game world sizes compared to CD-based games on competitor consoles. 
While the standard display resolution was 640x480 pixels, a few games like Kirby 64 and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask supported higher resolutions when played with an expansion pack accessory. This helped improved framerates and visual quality. The N64's hardware was designed for 3D rendering through its ability to process polygons in real-time, representing a big change from the 2D sprites of Super Nintendo games.

## Super Nintendo Graphics Abilities
### Iconic 16-Bit Visuals
Launched in 1990, the Super Nintendo was Nintendo's 16-bit successor to the massively popular NES. It could display from a palette of 512 colors at a maximum resolution of 512x448 pixels. This allowed for vibrant, detailed 2D art and animation that has aged remarkably well. Some games utilized enhancement chips to push the SNES further, such as the Super FX chip in Star Fox. This provided hardware accelerated 3D polygon rendering for select early 3D games. 
Another technique the SNES employed was Mode 7, a pseudo-3D effect that manipulated sprites and backgrounds through scaling, rotation and other transformations. This added a sense of speed and depth, famously seen in games like F-Zero. Titles like Donkey Kong Country were pushing the graphical envelope, demonstrating detailed 2D art superior to many 16-bit era PC games through techniques like pre-rendered 3D backgrounds.
## PlayStation's Powerful Hardware
### Advancing the PlayStation Revolution
Released in 1994, Sony's PlayStation was the company's debut in the video game industry. It utilized CDs which enabled vastly larger game install sizes up to 700MB compared to cartridges. The PlayStation featured a 32-bit R3000 RISC CPU running at 33MHz along with 1MB of RAM and 1MB of VRAM for graphics. 
This raw hardware power allowed for more advanced 3D polygons and higher resolution, higher quality textures than games on the Nintendo 64. Early 3D titles like Ridge Racer showed off its capabilities, while Resident Evil and particularly Tomb Raider leveraged the processing power to attract a new generation of gamers with their cinematic 3D action. Some early textures did suffer from minor warping issues due to the complex nature of 3D rendering at the time.
## Comparing Cartridges and CDs
### The Storage Race
The N64's cartridges topped out at around 64MB, severely limiting many third party developers seeking to port larger games from competitor consoles. CDs enabled the PlayStation to ship games utilizing the full 700MB capacity. This allowed PlayStation games to feature full motion video cutscenes, advanced audio quality beyond MIDI, and vastly larger game worlds than possible on cartridges. The storage capacity difference was one of the biggest factors driving third party support away from Nintendo's console that generation.
## Development Comparison  
### Easier Paths to Publishing 
While more powerful, the PlayStation was also significantly easier and less expensive for third party developers to create games on compared to cartridge-based systems like the Nintendo 64 and SEGA Saturn. Sony also charged publishers lower licensing fees than Nintendo, further incentivizing multiplatform support. These factors brought a flood of additional games from all major publishers to the PlayStation ecosystem and established it as the preeminent console for third party games that generation.
## Graphics Analysis Over Time
### PlayStation Leads, SNES Ages Well
Whereas the PlayStation delivered more advanced 3D capabilities at launch, the Nintendo 64 found success through signature exclusive series like Mario, Zelda and Smash Bros that revolutionized their genres. However, as the generation continued, the crude textures and lower resolutions of N64 games showed their limitations compared to PlayStation titles enhanced for larger install sizes and discs' streaming capabilities. 
Conversely, while dated in the 3D department, the Super Nintendo's 2D visuals hold up remarkably well due to their simpler sprite-based graphics. Titles like Donkey Kong Country demonstrated a peak of 2D hand-drawn artistry at the time with detailed animations complimenting tight responsive controls. These factors have allowed SNES games to remain visually pleasing while early 3D has aged the roughest.
## Conclusion 
### Revolution and Legacy
The PlayStation established Sony as a leader in home consoles by delivering hardware advanced enough to cultivate new franchises and genres focusing on cinematic 3D action adventures. However, Nintendo found vital footing with exclusive series leveraging the N64's novel controller and multi-dimensional gameplay. As the pioneer of home console gaming, Nintendo's software acumen kept them competitive despite technical shortcomings. 
Meanwhile, the Super Nintendo demonstrated how far 2D could be pushed, resulting in timeless 16-bit classics. Its games emphasize vibrant visuals and responsive controls bolstered by enhancement chips, establishing a foundation for Nintendo and others parties' 2D prowess for years to come. In summary, each system left behind a distinct legacy - the PlayStation revolutionized 3D, Nintendo innovated software, and the SNES exemplified 2D gaming refinement.
