## The Original Xbox One Controller
The original controller that launched alongside the first Xbox One console back in 2013 featured a distinctive glossy Xbox logo button and proprietary wireless connection that required a large power brick. While it provided the core function of navigating menus and controlling games, it was limited to outputting video up to only 1080p resolution. The sleek front panel buttons also felt a cut above the slightly cheaper-feeling plastic employed on later iterations. However, for basic gaming needs, it got the job done capably.
## Introducing Enhancements with the One S Controller
A few years later in 2016, Microsoft debuted an updated Xbox One S console that came bundled with a revamped controller. The new pad gained the convenience of Bluetooth connectivity for pairing with Windows 10 PCs and mobile devices in addition to continuing compatibility with Xbox via radio frequency. Its wireless range was also modestly extended. Ergonomically, perks included front-facing USB-C charging ports and a noticeably slimmer profile without the bulky power brick attatched. Overall comfort was subtly improved through a refined shape that still felt natural for those accustomed to the classic Xbox design language.
### Refined Ergonomics and Button Feedback  
While some nostalgically preferred the crisp click of the original controller's two-piece front panel over the integrated single-piece construction of newer models, enhancements were made. Textured grip sections around the bumpers and triggers delivered a subtly enhanced hold feeling less prone to slips. The face buttons also saw refinement, offering feedback that was arguably a hair improved for fast and fluid inputs even if lacking that certain tactile pop.

### Utilizing the L3 and R3 Buttons
Nestled within the flexible mushroom domes of the left and right analog sticks sit lesser known pressure-activated buttons labeled L3 and R3. Rather than simply moving the sticks, these inward pressing inputs unlock new functionality beyond basic movement depending on the game. Titles like the Metal Gear series notoriously used them for sneaking actions or weapon selections adding depth. For racing games, they can control camera views or toggle displays. Their potential remains untapped in many titles though.
## Finding the Ideal Controller for Your Setup
With a variety of Xbox One consoles and controller iterations available, determining the right pick depends highly on individual needs and existing hardware. Those still running an original Xbox One will want to stick with the already included pad or opt for its direct replacement. Upgrading to an Xbox One S brings the convenience of its compact design and multi-device support, favored by many. When selecting extras, carefully consider specs and features that line up best with planned usage scenarios.
### Leveraging 4K and HDR Via the console
While both controller types function identically for general controls, only those hooked up to an Xbox One S or newer Xbox One X are able to fully access the consoles' enhanced playback abilities. 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray discs can be experienced in stunning ultra-high definition visual quality along with streaming 4K video with high dynamic range colors bringing enhanced vibrancy. Sadly, games themselves remain limited to a maximum 1080p regardless of which pad is used due to hardware limitations of the original Xbox One design. 
### Drastically Lowered Power Consumption
Putting the controllers through rigorous testing reveals that even while merely idling in the menu or streaming video, the original Xbox One pulls startlingly more watts from the wall compared to optimized newer models. The numbers truly differentiate during intense gaming sessions with the launch unit drawing upwards of 50w while an Xbox One S only uses roughly half that. Lower electricity costs and reduced carbon footprint provide further incentive to upgrade older systems.
## Unmatched Compatibility and Durability
Whether many years have passed or a new Xbox emerges, both the initial Xbox One controller and iteration for the One S deliver smooth, familiar controls that feel at home anywhere in the Microsoft console ecosystem. Their wireless communication protocol has remained constant, allowing any supported game owned digitally or physically to be played interchangeably on the original One, updated One S, and high-powered One X. Additionally, both withstand hundreds of hours of intense gaming sessions without showing premature wear, making them practical long-term accessories.
In conclusion, either Xbox One controller choice is a sensible pick depending on needs, offering the trusted foundation for intuitive gameplay across the entire Xbox One family of consoles old and new. Their unmatched longevity and compatibility ensure satisfaction for many gaming generations ahead.
