## A new era of leadership at OpenAI
Emmett Shear recently took over as CEO of OpenAI, bringing his experience scaling Twitch to help guide the nonprofit’s ambitious vision. Shear co-founded Twitch, an AI-reliant platform with a strong focus on user engagement. His leadership helped Twitch become hugely popular by prioritizing how users interact on the platform. Shear's approach could influence how OpenAI develops and applies its technologies.
### Emphasizing practical applications 
Under Shear’s leadership, OpenAI may place greater emphasis on making AI more accessible and useful. Increasing public access to AI could be a priority to spur innovation by diverse groups. Shear may also foster more collaborations to help OpenAI make concrete progress on important technical and societal challenges.

## Cultivating a culture of responsibility 
Leadership style shapes company culture and impacts employee satisfaction. Shear’s communication and decision making will influence how OpenAI’s workforce views its mission. A supportive internal environment also impacts retention and the organization’s ability to attract top talent. Developing AI responsibly requires keeping employees invested in the work. 
### Regularly updating stakeholders
To build credibility, OpenAI must maintain transparency about challenges, setbacks, and diligence around risks. Regular status reports that detail progress, concerns, and oversight can help the public and partners feel confident in OpenAI’s leadership and direction. Updates demonstrate a commitment to responsibility that benefits society.
## Prioritizing user involvement with safeguards  
Twitch engaged users by making interaction central to the experience. Shear may take a similar approach, stress testing AI systems with real users to ensure they are helpful, harmless, and honest. However, oversight is needed to prevent potential harms. Public accessibility must be balanced with appropriate controls and standards.
## Continually assessing impact and refining strategy
As a new CEO, Shear is adjusting to his role while strategic plans take shape. Over time, his leadership style and priorities will become clearer through announcements and actions. An evolving approach allows reevaluating impact and refining strategy based on progress, setbacks experienced, and stakeholder feedback. This flexible mindset builds trust that innovation and responsibility are core priorities.
# A balancing act between progress and responsibility
Pushing boundaries is important for advancing beneficial AI applications. However, developers must consider unintended consequences, inequalities, and how to address ethical issues proactively. Open dialogue about challenges supports continued learning and credibility for future work. Responsible development also requires transparency to convince the public their concerns are being heard. By maintaining this balance, Shear can help OpenAI earn continued trust and support as a leader in the field.
