## Introduction 
The issue of digital game ownership is still not definitively settled. Questions remain around players' ability to resell games purchased on online marketplaces. This post aims to provide clarity on some common queries surrounding reselling digital PlayStation titles. Key differences between physical and digital games will also be outlined.
### Clarifying Digital Game Ownership
While players agree to terms of service restricting the transfer of digital content, exceptions do exist. Options for reselling vary based on the game and platform. It's important to understand limitations to avoid account terminations. Overall, ownership concepts from physical media don't always apply in digital ecosystems.

## Terms of Service Restrictions
When purchasing games digitally, lengthy terms are agreed to upon account creation. These explicitly state that downloaded content and the account itself cannot be sold or transferred to another user. Violating this risks suspension or banning. 
### Prohibiting The Resale of Digital Licenses
Platform holders like Sony argue this is necessary to protect developers and combat fraud. If unrestricted resale was allowed, it could undermine new game sales. However, some see this as overly restrictive of consumers' ownership rights. There is no consensus on where to draw the line.
## Exceptions to Reselling 
While the general terms forbid reselling, limited options do exist in rare cases. 
### Reselling Unused Download Codes
Codes for digital games that have not been redeemed can sometimes be resold online. This allows the transfer of a purchasable license rather than an account. However, options are limited.
### Gift Giving on Select Platforms 
A few services permit gifting games to others once purchased as a limited form of transfer. But the recipient's account must be added, not the gifted game directly resold.
### Rare Exceptions for Delisted Games
In unusual situations, like the beloved but delisted P.T. demo, downloaded games may no longer be redownloadable after a platform update. Even then, the full terms still apply.
## Preference for Physical Media
While restricted in resale, digital games provide convenience. But for some, physical discs remain preferable.
### Freely Trading and Collecting Games
Once purchased, discs can be lent, given away, or resold at will without depending on a company's policy. They also allow building a video game collection on shelves.
### No Risk of Remote Game Deletion  
Games on discs will continue working forever without risk of being remotely removed from the user's console due to licensing issues. This preserves access over time.
## Console/Account Sharing
Purchased games are permanently tied to the account, not the physical console. However, household sharing options do soften this.
### Primary/Secondary PlayStation Status  
By designating one console as "primary" for an account, its games can be played by any user on that device. A "secondary" option also allows logging into others online to access libraries.
### Managing Concurrent Logins
Between the primary and secondary devices, games cannot be played simultaneously on both. Disconnecting one account logs the other out to enforce this.
## Factory Resetting Consoles
Selling a used console requires scrubbing all prior user data and digital licenses.
### Erasing Console Software 
Performing a factory reset wipes all profiles, settings and downloaded content from the system back to fresh out-of-box condition. This protects the original owner's privacy. 
### Ensuring Licenses Transfer Only With Accounts
By resetting, the new owner will not gain unexpected access to leftover digital games without signing in. Only licenses officially tied to an account can be redownloaded.
## Refund Policies
While game platforms aim to limit refunds, some leniency does exist for unforeseen issues.
### Limited Digital Game Refund Windows
In general, refunds are not possible for downloaded games once played beyond a brief trial period, whether disliked or not. Buyers must be certain first.
### Exceptions for Defective Products
If a newly purchased digital game proves utterly broken or unplayable due to technical faults, compensation may be granted as quality control. 
### Disappointment Alone Does Not Qualify 
However, a game simply failing to meet one's personal expectations does not entitle customers to returns as with physical retailers. Digital buyers must research purchases carefully.
## Playing Offline 
While internet-dependent games won't work offline, most games do not mandate a constant connection. 
### Offline Single-Player Modes 
Many titles allow completing campaigns and modes without online authentication. Saved data works offline when reconnecting later. 
### Checking Requirements First
It's worth double-checking a game's features for offline viability before buying. Multiplayer focused titles naturally need net access more.
## Partner Development Requirements
Getting content approved and distributed via online marketplaces requires meeting each company's criteria.
### Established Developers Prioritized 
Larger publishers with proven track records face less stringent testing standards from Sony in particular. Early access is easier.
### Indie Studios Favor Alternatives
Independent teams may find the App Store and Google Play more accommodating of innovative new projects that don't hit every category. Still, quality is key everywhere.
### Technical and Business Specifications Apply
No matter the size, creating compliant, stable, accessible, and safe experiences as intended is a minimum standard to reach players. Iterative approval steps help.
The realm of digital game ownership continues developing as technology and markets evolve. Understanding companies' stances as well as consumers' rights aids making informed choices in this space.
