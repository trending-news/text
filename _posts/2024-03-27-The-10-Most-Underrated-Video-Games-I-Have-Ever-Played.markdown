## Introduction
Growing up as a gamer, there are always games that somehow flew under the radar or didn't get the attention they deserved. This list compiles 10 video games that I believe are severely underrated and deserve more recognition. From classic Nintendo titles to overlooked PS3 games, these are games that did things differently or brought unique experiences but didn't seem to connect with a wide audience upon their initial release. 
### Mega Man 3 
Released in 1990 on the NES, Mega Man 3 took everything great about the franchise and improved upon it. The Robot Masters offered fun and varied boss fights with unique weapons to acquire. The music was catchy and fit each stage perfectly. While not as difficult as Mega Man 2, it was highly optimized and refined the Mega Man formula. Its creativity and replay value made it one of the strongest entries yet it often gets overlooked between Mega Man 2 and Mega Man X.

## Okami  
Released in 2006 on the PS2, Okami placed players in the shoes of Amaterasu, a wolf goddess who could manipulate nature. Its lush visuals were inspired by classical Japanese ink wash paintings, bringing environments to life. Unique celestial brush techniques like growing vines or setting things aflame added an engaging layer of puzzle solving. Its emotional story of restoring light to Japan made for an epic adventure. While praised upon release, it never achieved mainstream success despite being a one-of-a-kind game.
## Bioshock 2
While many found the first Bioshock a masterpiece, its 2010 sequel Bioshock 2 had the misfortune of following such a beloved game. Taking place about 10 years after the events of the original, players control a Big Daddy on a quest to rescue and protect a Little Sister. Featuring the same hauntingly beautiful underwater city of Rapture with its objectivist ideology falling to pieces, this sequel expanded upon mechanics and story in all the right ways. As a polished successor that dared to continue the franchise, it deserved more acclaim.
### Sonic 3  
Released in 1994 on the Sega Genesis, Sonic 3 took the side-scrolling Sonic formula to new heights. It introduced friend Tails as a second playable character and expanded the game world with dynamic special stages. With its catchy music and challenging but fast-paced level design, it heightened the thrill of going fast. Combined with Sonic & Knuckles, it delivered one of the most expansive 16-bit experiences. Despite pushing the series forward, it often plays second fiddle to memories of Sonic 1 & 2 in public perception.  
## Doom 3
While many franchise entries expanded the scope of the first-person shooter, 2004â€™s Doom 3 took things back to survival horror roots. Atmospheric lighting, isolating level design and an eerie metal soundtrack amplified tension as demonic creatures lurked around every corner. A focus on resource management and avoiding danger over all-out combat encouraged stealth. This shift in tone divided fans but those who embraced the slow-paced terror found one of the scariest games on the original Xbox and PC.
## Super Smash Bros. Brawl
Released in 2008 for the Nintendo Wii, Super Smash Bros. Brawl took the addictive crossover fighting of the series and expanded the formula with a massive roster, stages and modes. Its Subspace Emissary story mode delivered an experience unlike any other fighting game. A surprisingly deep single-player and multiplayer offering, it was jam-packed with content. While praised, it faced expectations of revolutionizing the formula after Melee and the emergence of other fighters. But make no mistake - Brawl was one of the most fully-featured games on the Wii.
## DmC: Devil May Cry
A controversial 2013 reboot of the classic action-hack and slash series, DmC: Devil May Cry attracted criticism for reimagining main character Dante as a crass, modern take on thecharacter. But past initial distaste for the visual shift, what emerged was truly one of the most refined character action games ever made. It optimized responsive combat, rewarded player expression and featured some of the craziest set pieces in gaming. While not connecting with old-school fans, as its own entity it was one of the best games on the PS3 and Xbox 360 in its generation. 
## Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty
A 2001 sequel to the espionage classic MGS, Sons of Liberty expanded the stealth-action formula to new depths. Praised for its post-modern self-aware commentary on information control and digital surveillance, it delivered an intricately-plotted cinematic thrill ride. Gameplay saw the addition of new moves, weapons and refined stealth. Alongside its bonkers story reveals, it presented truly ahead of its time ideas and mechanics. Widely praised, it was nevertheless a controversial sequel that may not have received its due in how it evolved the MGS experience.
## Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception
The 2011 PS3 title took Naughty Dog's acclaimed adventure series to new heights. Spectacular set pieces like a sinking cruise ship and collapsing chateau punctuated a globe-trotting treasure hunt. Nate's personality and relationships felt authentic through stellar voice acting and animation. Stealth, combat and platforming flowed together gorgeously. While praised, it released late in the PS3 generation when focus shifted to impending new hardware. But make no mistake, Uncharted 3 was a technical marvel that saw the series peak in ways even its beloved successors did not match.  
## Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link  
The infamous 1988 NES sequel to the original Legend of Zelda divided fans upon release for its radical departure into tough-as-nails side-scrolling action-RPG territory. Today, playing with the benefit of hindsight and online guidance, its depth shines through - a massive overworld with towns to explore, experience levels to gain and magic spells to learn. Frustrating at the time, Zelda 2 pushed the series forward with new systems. While challenging, it deserves respect for taking risks and expanding what a Zelda game could be before the safer 3D formula found its feet.
## Conclusion
While commercial success isn't the only metric, these 10 games in my view did not connect with as wide an audience as their quality deserved upon release. Each brought bold new ideas, refined their genres or took risks in presentation and storytelling that may have turned some away. But revisiting them with an open mind reveals deep, thoughtful experiences that hold up remarkably well given their respective eras. They demonstrate how easily innovation can be missed. I hope shining new light on underdogs like these inspires more to give them a chance.
