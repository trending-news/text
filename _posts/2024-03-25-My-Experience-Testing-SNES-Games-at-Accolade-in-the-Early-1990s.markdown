## Getting My Foot in the Door   
I started working as a video game tester at Accolade in the early 1990s. It was my first job in the video game industry and a dream come true for a young gamer like myself. I had applied on a whim after graduating high school not knowing what career path to take. To my surprise, I received a call back for an interview. During the interview, I emphasized my passion for games and problem solving abilities which must have impressed them enough to give me a chance.  
My first day on the job was eye opening. I was shown to a cramped cubicle that I would have to share with another tester. The cubicle space was minimal and felt cramped with two desks shoved in. My cubicle mate seemed cool though and we bonded over our love of SNES games. At least the company provided free soda which was a nice perk to keep our energy up during long testing sessions. It was a humble start but I was excited to be breaking into the industry, even in an entry level testing role.
### Daily Grind of Game Testing
When a new build of a game would come in, usually daily, we testers would each grab a copy to dive in. The goal was to play through the entire game, over and over, looking for any bugs or issues. We used bug tracking software to document every single flaw we discovered - crashed, glitches, incorrect dialogue, broken levels, you name it. Once we could no longer replicate a reported bug, we would mark it as "closed" in the system. Then it was onto testing a new level or build to see if any new problems popped up. Rinse and repeat - this was the daily routine as a video game tester. 
The work could get tedious replaying the same levels or moments repeatedly but it was still more fun than most office jobs. We took pride in our ability to break games and find even the most obscure of bugs. There was a healthy competitiveness between testers to see who could uncover the most issues in a build. Of course, all that repetitive gameplay also got tiring by the end of a 10 hour shift. My hands and eyes would feel drained yet my mind was buzzing with gameplay.

### Programmers vs. Testers
While us testers toiled away in our cramped cubicles, the programmers occupied a more spacious open area downstairs. They had nicer individual workstations compared to our shared, minimal spaces. It quickly became evident the testers were regarded as lower on the totem pole. Programmers had prestige titles and salary while we were paid a low hourly wage. 
Understandably the programmers saw themselves as more skilled and integral to the development process. But we testers felt equally as important in ensuring quality and polish. Without us exhaustively breaking their code, many bugs would have slipped through the cracks. There was an inherent us vs them mentality between the two roles that caused tensions at times. We testers definitely got the shorter end of the stick when it came to resources and respect within the company structure.
### Delivering Builds for Testing
When a game was nearing completion, it was time for us testers to receive the latest build on actual SNES hardware. The QA lead was responsible for burning the game files and code onto EPROMS, which functioned like the game cartridges of the time. These EPROMS were then loaded into empty SNES cartridge shells by hand. 
Testing directly on console gave a seamless experience compared to emulators. It allowed finding hardware-specific bugs like graphics glitches only visible on a TV. The QA lead would distribute a batch of cartridges to testers who would sign them out. This process allowed rapid testing of the most up-to-date code changes from the programmers. It was exciting to get our hands on physical copies and really put the games through their paces on console.
## Some Memorable Games
Over my years testing at Accolade, many memorable titles passed through our hands including some based on popular movies and TV shows. However, one of the most enjoyable games for us testers personally was the bizarre puzzle game Ballz published by Accolade itself. The gameplay involved rolling colorful balls through obstacle courses in creative ways. 
All the testers got a real kick out of Ballz and would often find ourselves playing for fun past "official testing hours". Yet for some strange reason, perhaps too bizarre a concept or strange marketing, Ballz never seemed to resonate with consumers. While highly enjoyable to play ourselves, it remains a cult classic that found little commercial success. Goes to show testing room appeal doesn't always translate to mainstream popularity.
Of course any individual game, no matter how fun at first, also gets fatiguing when forced to play for 10 straight hours each day as part of the job. Repetition is the testers worst enemy and it was key to rotate assignments frequently to keep our minds engaged. Still, Ballz holds a fun place in my memory from those early days in the industry.
## Transitioning to Programming
After a couple years of testing games at Accolade, I decided it was time to expand my skills. The entry level nature of testing and lack of growth opportunities was no longer fulfilling my ambitions. I took the testing experience and parlayed it into a programming role at another developer focused on PC games. 
My testing background proved invaluable for understanding the developer side and how to structure robust, bug-free code. It also gave me a technical foundation to start learning different programming languages like C++ and tools like assembly. This allowed a smooth transition into a back-end programming career helping bring all sorts of games to life on Windows instead of just consoles. 
Looking back, that early testing job was the foot in the door I needed to break into the industry. It provided hands on experience that set me up for bigger roles down the line. Though testing comes with its own challenges, I'm grateful for the opportunities it opened up and the path it set me on within gaming.
## Game Genies and Cheating Devices
During the golden age of SNES and other consoles, a whole market emerged for devices that allowed "cheating" in games. Chief among these were Game Genies, devices that could be plugged in line between the console and game cartridge. Players could then input codes that granted effects like unlimited lives, money or power-ups when playing.
As testers, we of course had to test such devices to evaluate any compatibility issues or unintended behaviors they caused in our games. Some more advanced cheating devices even programmed themselves to auto-scan games and generate optimal codes. They worked using similar principles to programming - electrically intercepting and altering values being sent between cartridge and console on the fly. 
Naturally as consumers, many kids and casual gamers used Genies and other cheats to experience more of a game or get past difficult parts. But for us in testing, they served as a fun diversion or experiment outside our day jobs. It was interesting to see the technical side of what made these cheat plug-ins operate under the hood. Overall the devices had little meaningful impact on our testing work besides providing some entertainment when not rigorously testing builds.
In conclusion, I look back fondly on my early days testing SNES games at Accolade in the 90s. It was a humble beginning in the industry I loved that set me up well for future success. I gained invaluable experience on the production side of development while getting hands on with some truly classic titles. It lit a fire that has kept me passionate about gaming to this day, both as a player and lifelong member of this creative field. I hope this glimpse into the past shows how a simple testing role can open many doors.
