### The 16-bit powerhouse
The SNES boasted specifications that rivaled competitors like the Sega Genesis despite its slower CPU. It featured twice the RAM of 4MB, higher quality stereo sound capabilities compared to the Genesis' mono sound, and graphics capabilities like mode 7 scaling that allowed rotating and scaling of sprites. These powerful internals allowed developers to create games with vibrant colors and detailed graphics that pushed the limits of what was possible on a home console at the time.

### A library of beloved classics
The SNES library included beloved titles across various popular genres like platformers, RPGs, fighting games, and more. Iconic platformers like Super Mario World showed off the fluid gameplay and detailed graphics the SNES was capable of. RPG epics like Chrono Trigger and Secret of Mana immersed players in sprawling worlds with engaging storylines. Fighting games Street Fighter II and Super Smash Bros delivered competitive local multiplayer. The quality and variety of games defined the golden era of 2D gaming on the SNES. 
### Timeless visuals and mechanics 
SNES games have noticeably aged better than early 3D titles from the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation era. The stylized 2D visuals found in games like The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past still hold up today compared to dated low polygon 3D graphics. Complex mechanics and depth found in strategy RPGs like Fire Emblem and Tactics Ogre also remain engaging. While technology has advanced exponentially, the gameplay fundamentals pioneered in 16-bit SNES classics endure.
### Building on NES success
Riding the coattails of the iconic NES, the SNES sold over 49 million units by 2003 as Nintendo's successor console. It quickly outsold the Genesis with a library focused on beloved Nintendo franchises receiving much anticipated sequels, in addition to new intellectual properties. Games like Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island and Star Fox showed veterans receiving expanded adventures while introducing new characters. The success cemented Nintendo as the leader of the burgeoning gaming industry.
### Price increases over time
While priced at $199.99 at launch in 1990, considered more affordable than the NES, inflation has taken its toll. Adjusted for over 25 years of rising costs, that initial MSRP would be worth over $395 today. Game prices similarly inflated from $49.99 to over $90 in adjusted terms. This highlights how costs have exponentially grown since Nintendo and Sony revolutionized the home console market in the early 90s.
### A dream retro compilation 
Fans continue dreaming of an official "SNES Classic" miniature console with 20+ built-in retro games. A package at $80 containing beloved titles that never received ports like EarthBound, Secret of Mana, and Super Mario RPG could deliver a true nostalgia experience. Enough to transport players back to weekends spent adventuring in memorable 16-bit lands. With the success of NES and Super NES Mini systems, the demand for a full-fledged SNES Classic remains high. 
### Hong Kong 97 and unlicensed games
A bizarre outlier in the stellar SNES library was the unlicensed and notoriously controversial Hong Kong 97. Developed by Express Software on a limited budget, it satirized the 1997 Handover of Hong Kong through crudely animated scenes and an English language corrupted with profanity. While offensively crass, it showed what studios could achieve outside Nintendo's tight control. It grew a cult following for its offbeat take on contemporary sociopolitical events. 
### Reliving classics through emulation 
For those unable to purchase an ever-inflating retro cartridge collection, emulation provides an affordable alternative. With a Raspberry Pi loaded with RetroPie, the entire SNES library of over 800 games is at your fingertips. Spending weekends emulating classics like Final Fantasy VI, Chrono Trigger and Super Metroid transports players back to gaming's golden era defined by the SNES. Systems like MiSTER also faithfully recreate the 16-bit console experience at an affordable cost. 
### Fond memories of formative years
For a generation, the SNES delivered adventures of Mario, Zelda, Kirby, and more colorful characters during formative childhood years. Its library included titles that defined genres, set graphical standards, and became part of nostalgic memories. Over 30 years later, the SNES legacy endures thanks to faithful emulation keeping its best games playable for new generations. Its colorful 2D visuals and gameplay fundamentals have aged better than contemporaries and inspired modern indie titles paying homage. Few systems capture the magic of retro 16-bit gaming like Super Nintendo.
