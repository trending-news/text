### Mathematics basics
Mathematics is the language of AI. To understand how AI systems work under the hood, you need a grasp of key math concepts. Linear algebra deals with vectors and matrices - critical for machine learning models. Calculus is used in optimization of loss functions. Statistics and probability help analyze datasets and determine confidence in predictions. Graph theory lends insights into network structures. Devote time to learning these mathematical building blocks to fully leverage AI's potential. Developing strong math skills takes practice, so be prepared to study regularly.
### Choosing a coding language   
With mathematics fundamentals in place, pick your first coding language. Python and Java are top choices for AI development. Python is universally popular due to its extensive AI/ML libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Keras and TensorFlow. Java is faster and better for complex enterprise applications. For beginners, Python is easier to learn while covering all essential AI coding needs. Whichever language you choose, practice coding everyday to strengthen your skills. Focus on core concepts like data structures, control flow, classes and objects.
### Working with datasets
Once coding proficient, you'll need to source and prepare real-world datasets for model training and testing. Relational databases stored in SQL are commonly used. Learn SQL to efficiently extract, clean, join and transform tabular data. Work with Pandas in Python to load, analyze and manipulate CSV/JSON datasets. Practice importing machine learning model APIs from coding language to datasets. Cleaning messy, unorganized data into a uniform structured format is a must for any AI project.
### Machine learning algorithms
With datasets in hand, dive into popular machine learning algorithms. Linear and logistic regression are simple techniques to predict continuous or categorical variables. Decision trees and random forests can be used for both regression and classification tasks. Support vector machines allow flexible model fitting for complex patterns. Clustering algorithms like K-means group unlabeled similar data. Get hands-on practice applying these basic algorithms to tackle your own problems or public datasets.
### Deep learning fundamentals
Deeper dive into the most productive area of AI - deep learning using neural networks. Study neural network architecture concepts like input/output layers, convolutional layers and more. Activation functions like ReLu and Sigmoid determine correct output patterns. Loss functions like cross-entropy error quantify model accuracy. Optimization techniques like gradient descent fine tune weights for best results. Frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras simplify model building. Practice constructing and training your own neural nets to recognize images, text or signals.
### Applications of AI  
Explore various domains where AI is revolutionizing technologies. Computer vision enables face recognition, object detection and self-driving cars. Natural language processing powers chatbots, translation and more. Reinforcement learning autonomously plays games and optimizes systems. Recommendation engines form the core of e-commerce sites and streaming services. Auditory processing helps build voice assistants while generative models create lifelike images and videos. Pick an application niche matching your interests and background to apply your AI expertise to real challenges.
### Online courses for learning AI
Supplement self-study with online courses from reputed universities. Coursera, edX and Udacity offer beginner to advanced level AI/ML courses taught by professors from top schools free or at low cost. Validate skills with certificates. Stanford, CMU, Berkeley programs impart a balanced theoretical and practical education via video lectures, assignments and projects. MOOCs give flexibility to learn at your own pace while connecting with global communities of AI learners. Strategically choose courses matching your current skill level and career goals. Take full advantage of these rich open education resources.
### Career pathways in AI  
With expertise across coding, mathematics, algorithms and technologies - specialize your skills for high-growth AI careers. Data scientists extract insights from large datasets to drive business decisions. Machine learning engineers develop scalable systems and new algorithms. Research scientists push the boundaries of what's possible with AI. UX designers apply AI to enhance user experiences. Product managers lead teams to create innovative AI products. Transition from entry level roles in software development to leadership as an AI expert. Continuously expand your knowledge-base through self-paced and higher education online to progress in the exciting field of artificial intelligence.
