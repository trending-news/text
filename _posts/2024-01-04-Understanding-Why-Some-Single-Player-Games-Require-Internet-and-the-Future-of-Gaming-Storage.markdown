## The Necessity of Internet Connections for Single-Player Games 
### Digital Rights Management and Licensing Verification
Many single-player games today require an internet connection due to the use of Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems by developers. DRM is used to protect against piracy by requiring online validation of licenses periodically. This ensures the game is legitimately owned by verifying the license with the developer's servers.

### Online Features and Multiplayer Components  
Even if the core single-player campaign of a game can be played offline, most titles include additional online features that enhance the experience. Things like global leaderboards, optional multiplayer modes, social sharing features, and downloadable content all require being connected to access. Maintaining an internet connection allows players to enjoy these extra elements.
### Regular Updates and Bug Fixes
With how complex modern games have become, it is necessary for developers to support titles with ongoing updates, patches, and hotfixes post-launch. These address any issues that arise like bugs or exploits. They also fine-tune and improve the gameplay over time based on community feedback. As such, single-player games still need internet to download and apply these ongoing improvements from developers.
## Differences Between Physical and Digital Game Distribution
### Licensing and Installation Process  
Physically distributed games are licensed by keeping the disc inserted since it acts as the "license key". But once installed, modern games are fully copied to the console storage for faster access during gameplay. Digital purchases tie the license directly to the user account, no disc needed. 
### Resale and Used Games Market
A key difference is the physical resale market for pre-owned games which does not exist digitally. Once a digital title is purchased, it remains tied to that account and console permanently without the option to resell. Physical copies allow exchanging ownership through second-hand sales.
### Storage and Install Size Requirements
Past generations transitioned from primarily physical to requiring complex installed environments utilizing internal storage. Discs proved too slow for the increasing demands of immersive 3D worlds and high-fidelity visuals. Next-gen standards will further cement downloads and optimized internal storage as core necessities.
## Increasing Install Sizes and the Limits of Physical Media 
### Exponential Growth of Game Data Volumes
While newer discs granted modest capacity boosts, the scope and detail gamers expect keeps installations larger each year. Development necessitates greater technical capabilities than physical formats can efficiently provide through slow random access times. 
### Installation to Storage Instead of Discs Alone  
Installing content locally during the era of DVD-capacity discs showed hardware was ready for immersive worlds but discs fell behind. Each generation utilizes internal storage more while new consoles ensure optimizations for enlarged libraries and installation speeds.
### Streaming as an Alternative to Storage Limits
Cloud gaming could bypass constraints of internal capacities by offloading processing demands and streaming gameplay. If latency concerns are addressed for intense genres, streaming may provide limitless "storage" without downloads once sufficient infrastructure exists. However, for most, broadband speeds remain a challenge presently.
## The Future of Console Gaming
### Downloads as the Primary Distribution 
Physical media will undoubtedly become obsolete as install sizes render discs unrealistic to include full feature sets and the highest graphical fidelity ambitions. Downloads allow keeping libraries up-to-date far easier than physical swapping. 
### SSD Storage Capacities and Throughput
Manufacturers will dedicate efforts towards incorporating optimized ultra-high-speed SSD solutions rather than depending HDDs as in past generations. Larger capacities and improved network standards assist growing game installs. 
### External SSD Expansion Support
Optional portable SSDs may offer means of expanding storage footprints and allow transferring titles between consoles for those regularly managing large libraries across devices. 
### Subscription Streaming Services
Streaming has promise but mainstream adoption depends on practical network speeds and infrastructure. If technical barriers are solved, streaming could compete with local hardware alternatives through limitless virtual storage and simplified access.
### Developer Optimization and Compression Advances
While gamers expect cutting-edge visuals, budgets and bandwidth still impose limits. Developers must wisely allocate install sizes versus benefits through careful optimization, asset compression, and future file type innovations to balance artistic vision with practical issues. 
### Industry Collaboration on Networking Standards  
Publishers collaborating with console-makers and ISPs can help expedite networking technology to ready households for tomorrow's 100GB+ blockbuster downloads as internet speeds become increasingly critical to gaming experiences.
