## Introduction
I had been enjoying my evenings relaxing and gaming on my PlayStation when one day I noticed something strange. When I logged into my PlayStation account, I saw a message that another user was already logged in from another location. Concerned, I tried logging in again but was unable to access my account. It seemed clear that my PlayStation account had been hacked. Now I needed to regain control of my account and reclaim it as my own.
### Contacting PlayStation Support  
The first step was contacting PlayStation support for help. I found their website and selected the option to report a compromised account. I explained that when attempting to log in, I was getting an error message saying my account was already in use elsewhere. I provided my email address, date of birth, and last four digits of the payment method attached to verify I was the legitimate owner. A support agent got back to me within a day to say they were investigating the issue.

### Troubleshooting Local Issues
While waiting to hear back, I decided to troubleshoot things on my end in case it was something simple I was overlooking. I restarted my PlayStation console just in case it was a glitch. When it booted back up, I tried logging in directly from the home screen instead of within a game. Still no luck accessing my account. I also checked that my console was set as the primary device for my PlayStation account in the settings menu, which it was. With no local fixes working, it seemed the account issue was server-side on PlayStation's end.  
## If Support Cannot Help
After a few days, I didn't hear back from support with an update. I gave them a call again to follow up. When I explained I was still unable to log into my account, the agent apologized but said they were still investigating. Frustrated, I politely asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor was able to see they had not made progress resolving my case. He assured me his team would work to prioritize it. If after another few days there was no resolution, he advised me to submit a formal complaint in writing. As a last resort, he mentioned the option to take PlayStation to small claims court if a significant amount of money was involved from purchases on my account.
### Account Security Best Practices
While waiting for PlayStation to regain control of my account, I took the time to review the security on it. I enabled two-factor authentication for my PSN login using the PlayStation mobile app. This added an extra layer of protection by requiring a one-time code even if someone knew my password. I also changed my password to be a long, random string of numbers, letters, and symbols. Going forward, I would be sure to use unique, strong passwords for all my important online accounts. Another lesson was to avoid sharing my login credentials with others to prevent account sharing scams.
## Preventative Measures  
This whole ordeal was a wakeup call to be more cautious online. One thing that likely led to my account being hacked was reusing passwords across sites. Hackers could have breached another site with a weak password of mine and tried it on PlayStation. Going forward, I would generate randomized, unique passwords for each account. Additionally, I started being wary of any suspicious messages or links, as phishing is a common hacking technique. I also installed antivirus software on my computer and consoles and kept all systems updated - weaknesses hackers prey on. Being more security-conscious could prevent this happening again in the future. 
### Lesson Learned
With the benefit of hindsight, it was clear how my account access was compromised. In the past, I had shared my login with a friend to let them play a game on my console when they visited. While I trusted this person, sharing account access led directly to this issue. In future, I would only share access with extremely close friends or family I knew well. Even then, it posed security risks. The lesson was that loose password security practices allowed my account to fall into the wrong hands online.
### Summary 
Losing access to my hard-earned PlayStation games and profile was frustrating. However, with diligence and persistence contacting support, I was able to regain control of my account in the end. Sony's PlayStation support took the issue seriously once I was able to prove legitimate ownership. While the hack was a hassle to resolve, the experience highlighted areas to shore up my overall online security. Implementing stronger practices like unique passwords, two-factor authentication and avoiding account sharing means hackers should no longer be able to compromise my PSN profile going forward.
