### Popular Backend Options for Flutter
Firebase is a backend platform developed by Google that offers a variety of backend services like realtime database, hosting, authentication etc. out of the box. It has tight integration with Flutter and makes mobile app development very easy and seamless. Developers don't have to spend time building common backend features from scratch. 
AWS Amplify is another fully-managed backend service for mobile and web applications. It is built on serverless architecture so developers don't have to manage infrastructure. AWS Amplify provides features like authentication, analytics, storage etc. and works well with Flutter. It offers great scalability and is very cost-effective for building production-ready apps.
If an app has custom requirements beyond what Firebase or AWS provide, developers can design their own REST APIs to satisfy those needs. Technologies like Node.js, Python, Java etc. can be used to build tailored backends exposing data and functionality via REST endpoints. This gives developers complete control over backend but requires managing servers.

### Backend Frameworks  
Node.js has gained a lot of popularity as a backend framework due to its speed, efficiency and scalability. It provides a robust ecosystem of packages and libraries via NPM. Many developers choose it to build RESTful services due to simple yet powerful functionality.
Python is another common choice for backend development because of its easy readability and extensive standard library. Frameworks like Django and Flask reduce a lot of boilerplate code and make it simple to develop feature-rich Web APIs. Their documentation and community support make Python an accessible option.
Java is considered an enterprise-grade language that scales easily with increasing complexity. The Spring Boot framework offers a streamlined approach to create Java-based backends with minimal configuration. Its widespread adoption makes Java suited for building robust APIs for large organizations.
### Database Choices
NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Firestore are very flexible in design and handle unstructured data well. They are highly scalable and fit for storing large amounts of user-generated content and metadata in realtime apps.
SQL databases provide a standardized way for managing data relationships through schemas and queries. Relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and AWS Aurora are well-equited for data that needs to be easily searched, aggregated, and manipulated via joins.
### Additional Technologies 
API gateways centralize API management and allow securing and throttling exposed endpoints. AWS API Gateway and Cloud Endpoints help govern serverless REST APIs.
Messaging queues like RabbitMQ and Kafka facilitate communication between backend services and asynchronous processing of tasks like notifications, emails, analytics etc.
Containerization using Docker simplifies building and deploying applications into containers which can then be efficiently orchestrated through Kubernetes clusters. This enables easy scaling of backend infrastructure.
### Choosing the Right Backend
Several factors need consideration when selecting a backend stack. Firebase is suitable for apps with simple data and auth requirements. AWS Amplify and custom APIs scale well for large enterprises. Existing technical skills within a team also guide the decision. 
Project needs around data structure, features, scalability goals and security preferences become important. Serverless options are cost-effective for unpredictable traffic. Supportability long-term and performance requirements also impact choice between fully-managed and self-hosted solutions.
### Server-side Programming
To build custom backends, server-side coding skills are essential. Developers must learn languages, frameworks commonly used for REST API development like Node.js, Python, Java/Spring etc. Familiarity with database management through ORM libraries and server provisioning on GCP, AWS etc. is also important.
### Integrating Backend and Flutter  
Once the backend is ready, Flutter provides HTTP and networking libraries to connect the mobile app to server APIs and fetch or send data. Packages like DIO simplify making HTTP requests to REST endpoints from the app. Data is retrieved or saved on the fly as needed by the mobile screens and functionality.
### Additional Considerations
Existing technical expertise within a development team helps decide whether to use technologies the team is already well-versed in or learn a new stack.
Long-term support, community engagement, technical documentation and how production-ready each option is also matter. Security best practices vary between services so applicable policies must align with compliance needs.
Every project has unique demands that guide backend decisions. Considerations around future enhancements and compatibility with other services need attention too. Iterative evaluation helps land on an infrastructure suitable for evolving business goals.
In conclusion, choosing the right backend stack and services depends a lot on app requirements, scalability vision and feasibility based on resources available. A well-planned backend provides a strong foundation for building feature-rich native Flutter apps.
