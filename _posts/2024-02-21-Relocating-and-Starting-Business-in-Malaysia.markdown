### Obtaining a Work Visa
Securing the proper documentation to work legally is essential. Find a Malaysian company willing to sponsor a visa application by accepting a job offer. Work visas allow foreign professionals to take long-term employment. Start networking to find opportunities and discuss sponsorship with potential employers. 
### Starting a Business in Malaysia
To establish a Malaysian company, foreign investors must invest a minimum of $125,000 USD. Becoming a company director provides an expatriate directorial visa allowing residence while overseeing daily operations. This pathway enables entrepreneurship through a locally incorporated firm.
### Understanding Malaysian Immigration Policies  
Thoroughly research the different types of long-stay visas and their eligibility criteria on the Malaysian Immigration Department website. Comply with regulations regarding visa validity periods, renewals and permitted employment or business activities. For professional guidance, hire a licensed Malaysian immigration lawyer familiar with the complex rules and application procedures.
### Adapting to Local Business Culture
Malaysian business customs blend Malay, Chinese and Indian influences with an emphasis on politeness and formality. Build relationships through frequent informal social meetings before substantive discussions. Seek cultural sensitivity training since traditions vary between ethnic groups. Understanding local norms eases integration into the professional community.
### Engaging Expat Support Networks
Join international chambers of commerce and industry groups for referrals and advice. Locate housing compounds and schools catering to expatriates through community forums and associations. Leverage expatriate networks to overcome cultural adjustment challenges and share knowledge on prospering in Malaysia's multicultural environment.  
### Conclusion
With preparation and utilization of available resources, relocating and doing business in Malaysia is achievable. Following legal pathways and adapting to local practices and customs paves the way for long-term success. The transition involves effort but yields rewards for those committed to Malaysia's opportunities.
