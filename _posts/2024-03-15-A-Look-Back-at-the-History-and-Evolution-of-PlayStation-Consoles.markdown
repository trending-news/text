## Sony Enters the Console Market  
In 1994, Japanese electronics giant Sony made their major entrance into the video game console market with the original PlayStation. At the time, Nintendo and Sega dominated the industry with their Super Nintendo and Genesis consoles. However, Sony saw an opportunity with their adoption of the new optical disc format CD-ROM which had ten times the storage capacity of cartridges. This allowed for larger, more immersive 3D worlds to be created. 
The original PlayStation was a pioneering console that helped popularize 3D gaming. It secured major third party support from developers who were eager to take advantage of the increased storage. Titles like Tomb Raider and Ridge Racer showed off what was possible on discs. By the end of its lifecycle over 100 million PlayStation units had been sold worldwide and it cemented Sony as a serious player in the industry.
### Dominating the Generation 
The CD format also lowered production costs for games compared to cartridges. This attracted many developers and publishers who were now able to create more robust titles. The expanded storage capacity enabled fully voice acted cutscenes and vibrant textures. This helped the PlayStation appeal beyond the core gamer audience and brought in many new fans. Its 3D capabilities outshined what the Nintendo 64 could offer. Memorable exclusives like Tekken 3 and Metal Gear Solid highlighted the system's 3D graphics prowess.
