### What Happens to Digital Games on Shutdown
Digital games purchased on platforms like Steam have become increasingly popular. However, some wonder what will happen to their game libraries if the service ever shuts down. In the past, when digital distributors like GameStation and Impulse were acquired or ceased operations, purchasers lost access to games in their libraries. This raises questions about how Steam shutdown might impact the hundreds of titles in user libraries.

### Potential Outcomes of a Steam Shutdown
There are a few possible outcomes should Steam ever shut down. Another company like Epic Games could acquire Steam and its assets, including user accounts and purchase histories, migrating libraries to their own storefront. Users might be able to sue for access to content they paid for if license agreements continue after shutdown. However, games not downloaded locally would likely be inaccessible without the authentication servers.
### Offline Play of Downloaded Games 
One benefit is any Steam games already downloaded to a user's machine could still be playable in offline mode by executing game files directly, bypassing the Steam client. This allows continued enjoyment of single-player titles without an internet connection. However, online-reliant or multiplayer games may lose functionality. Regular hard drive backups could preserve downloaded content long-term.
### Licensing vs Ownership of Digital Games
While purchasing games on Steam grants access to play, strict terms clarify this provides a license to the content, not outright ownership. Licenses are only valid so long as Steam remains operational and games function as intended. If authentication fails due to unforeseen closure, license agreements could terminate access independently of user purchase history. 
### Steam's Unlikely Shutdown in the Near Future
With over 120 million active users, Steam is extraordinarily profitable and faces no imminent risks to close operations. As the dominant PC gaming platform, Steam shows no signs of instability and continues expanding features. Absent unforeseeable catastrophic events, Steam will likely remain the primary destination for PC games well into the foreseeable future.
### Highly-Rated Free Games on Steam  
Some top-tier free-to-play choices include Dota 2, Team Fortress 2, Path of Exile, Warframe, and Destiny 2. All deliver dozens if not hundreds of hours of entertainment without cost. They remain fully playable without ongoing Steam authentication. DotA 2 in particular enjoys an engaged esports scene and consistently strong player base.
### Well-Received Games Under $20
Indie darlings like Stardew Valley, Hollow Knight, Celeste, Terraria and RimWorld offer immense value at $15-20. Each provides at least 40 hours of unique hand-crafted experiences. As primarily single-player adventures, they remain enjoyable even without internet access. Downloading these affordable gems builds a library to appreciate long-term. 
### Benefits of Steam Beyond the Game Library
Valuable community features like friend lists, activity feeds, screenshots and guides also remain viable regardless of future Steam operation. Sales, bundles, and Steam cards provide ongoing discounts motivating new purchases. The Workshop provides free mods, maps, and visual upgrades. Remote Play Together facilitates online/local multiplayer across distances. All enhance gaming value beyond the installed software library alone.
### Unlikely but Still Possible Shutdown
While extremely profitable with a huge userbase, unforeseen collapse of Steam's corporate owner Valve remains a remote hypothetical scenario. Should it ever transpire, options exist to preserve access to some purchased content locally. Meanwhile, Steam's popularity shows few signs of waning today. For most, concerns over a shutdown reflect unlikely what-ifs rather than immediate problems requiring solutions in the present. Valuable as both a digital game storefront and community platform, Steam continues serving PC gamers well for the foreseeable future.
