### Installing Games
Modern Xbox One games are largely installed from discs onto the console's hard drive for faster loading. Rather than running entirely from the disc, the Xbox installs key portions of the game files so it can quickly load levels, gameplay elements, and scenes without waiting on the disc to spin up. This installation process happens automatically when you insert a disc for the first time. 
Downloaded games are installed in the same way, pulling the full package of files from Xbox Live rather than a physical disc. No matter the source, installation to the hard drive makes a big difference in reducing load times and ensuring smoother gameplay. The tradeoff is using valuable space that could hold additional titles on your Xbox's storage.

### Playing from Discs
To enjoy a physical disc-based game once it's installed, you don't actually need to constantly keep the disc in the tray. However, the Xbox will periodically check that the original disc is present to verify your ownership. So while you don't have to swap discs in and out constantly, leaving the console for extended times may cause it to prompt you to reinsert the game disc before continuing play.  
When playing physical games, the disc itself isn't needed to load every asset - it acts more as a license check. As long as your original game purchase is authenticated, the full installation files on the hard drive are utilized for optimized performance.
### digital downloads
Fully downloaded digital games live exclusively on your console's internal storage or expanded external drive. When purchasing titles through the Xbox Store rather than retail discs, the entire game package streams directly onto your Xbox.
This disk-free approach means you'll never risk scratches or damage ruining a physical disc. And your library is always accessible no matter where you set up your console. However, bear in mind downloads take up significant space versus thin disc installs. Careful storage management is key with this all-digital method.
### External Hard Drives
Xbox One supports large high-capacity external USB hard drives for supplementing your console's baseline storage. These plug-and-play drives expand install space for beefier titles that demand 100GB of storage or more. 
Games can be moved freely between internal and external storage as needed. Unplugging an external drive doesn't delete installed games - they simply become inaccessible until reconnecting the drive. This flexibility helps optimize space on your Xbox for the games you're currently playing most.
### Sharing Digital Games
Microsoft enables sharing digital games between up to two Xbox consoles through the "Home Xbox" feature. By designating a friend's console as your Home system, any games or subscriptions you purchase on your account can then be accessed and played by their profile too. 
Likewise, your profile will be able to access and install all games bought by the owner of whatever Xbox you designate as your Home console. Both parties effectively pool your collective digital libraries for more flexible sharing between households or circles of friends.
### Multi-User Access
Taking advantage of Home Xbox sharing, multiple user accounts can simultaneously log into the same console and access different installed games without issues. So a family with two or more regular players need only buy games once rather than duplicating purchases per profile. 
The catch is that if the console someone is signed into isn't designated as their Home system, they count as an active user taking up a license spot. Multiple people can play shared titles together locally thanks to solid in-home bandwidth.
### Playing Others' Games  
Temporarily signing into a friend's Xbox Live profile on your console grants access to whatever games they've purchased digitally. This works for playing single-player campaigns or cooperatively over Xbox Live together in real-time. 
Keep in mind that logging into another account locally signs your own profile out. So only one person at a time can actively play on any given Xbox when borrowing access to friends' libraries this way. Be sure to log back into your main profile once finished.
### Used & Rented Discs
While new retail discs provide smoother performance with optimized pre-loads, second-hand physical copies from used game stores can still be installed, authenticated and played on Xbox One. Rental services may also utilize disc-sharing schemes allowing limited online access to match up with rental periods.
### Game Compatibility
Whether using discs or digital copies, the games themselves will function identically once installed. Switching between physical and download versions doesn't require reinstalling or repurchasing - the same game files are being accessed either way for seamless transitions. So feel free to combine disc and digital purchases without issues.
