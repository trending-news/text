### Introduction
The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One have been leading the current generation of video game consoles since their launches in 2013. While the PlayStation 4 has consistently outsold the Xbox One around a 2:1 ratio globally, Microsoft has been narrowing the gap with the release of the more affordable Xbox One S console in 2016. Both Sony and Microsoft have also been pushing their hardware further with support for 4K video and gaming. However, each console ecosystem offers different experiences through exclusive games, streaming options, virtual reality, and online services that gamers must weigh when choosing their preferred platform.

### Hardware Specifications
At their core, the PS4 and Xbox One utilize similar hardware architecture with x86-64 processors and 8GB of RAM. However, the PS4 uses a slightly faster AMD Jaguar CPU and GDDR5 memory, allowing games to target and often reach 1080p resolution. The Xbox One originally launched with DDR3 RAM, making it less capable of matching the PS4's graphical performance. This changed with the Xbox One S, which added support for 4K video playback as well as higher resolution and high dynamic range (HDR) capabilities in select games. Both Sony and Microsoft have also announced upcoming hardware revisions, with PlayStation's Neo promising improved 4K gaming capabilities while Project Scorpio vows to deliver true 4K experiences in 2017. 
### Backward Compatibility  
One major advantage of the Xbox One is its extensive backward compatibility support for Xbox 360 games. Through both emulation and optimized ports, over 100 Xbox and Xbox 360 games can now be played locally on the Xbox One. In comparison, PlayStation Now is Sony's approach which streams select PS3 games over the internet for a rental fee. However, PlayStation Now lacks the comfort of offline local play.
### Exclusive Games
First-party exclusive games have long swayed console wars, and both the PS4 and Xbox One ecosystems offer compelling exclusive franchises. The PS4 is home to hugely successful new entries like Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, with upcoming titles such as Santa Monica Studio's God of War also generating buzz. Meanwhile, the Xbox benefits from established franchises like Gears of War and upcoming new games like Crackdown 3 and Scalebound. However, most multi-platform titles from publishers like Bethesda, Activision, and Ubisoftrelease on both consoles.
### Expanding the Platform
Beyond the consoles themselves, both Sony and Microsoft have also been expanding their ecosystems into other areas. The PS4 supports remote play and digital game streaming to Windows PCs and Macs, while Xbox allows game streaming from an Xbox One to any Windows 10 device on the same network. This October, PlayStation will launch PlayStation VR for enhanced virtual reality gaming experiences exclusively on the PS4. And Microsoft has begun experimenting with augmented reality through HoloLens as well as the advanced Xbox Elite wireless controller.
### Online Services  
Both PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live Gold provide robust online multiplayer functions. However, their included free games libraries and extended features differ substantially. PlayStation Plus subscribers gain access to a rotating library of monthly free games on PS4, while Xbox Live members can enjoy Game DVR screenshot/video capture, Looking for Group tools, and early access to emerging EA games through EA Access.
### Outlook
Looking ahead, Project Scorpio promises to be the most powerful console ever built with support for true 4K gaming. However, PlayStation's Neo will also boost the PS4 family with improved 4K compatibility starting this year. Backwards compatibility, virtual and augmented reality, plus multi-platform cross-over experiences will likely define the next evolution of home consoles across both ecosystems. 
### Choosing a Console
For many gamers, deciding between PlayStation or Xbox ultimately comes down to exclusive software and preferences in games genres. The PlayStation 4 continues to have an edge in the quantity and critical success of its exclusive franchises. However, Xbox provides parity with multi-platform releases and stronger streaming integration with Windows PC games. Budget constraints and preferred genres such as shooters or JRPGs may also influence each buyer's individual priorities until the next generation of hardware arrives.
### Conclusion  
With new hardware revisions from both companies on the horizon, the PlayStation 4 retains its established sales lead over the Xbox One for now. However, Microsoft is making gains and remains fully committed to the platform. Innovation in hardware, games, virtual/augmented experiences and online features makes this an ongoing close competition. Only time will tell which ecosystem emerges in the strongest position once the dust settles on Project Scorpio and PlayStation Neo.
