### PS4 History and Specifications
The PlayStation 4 was first released in November 2013 and has sold over 117 million units worldwide making it a highly successful console generation for Sony. Some key specifications include an x86-64 AMD "Jaguar" CPU, a Radeon based graphics card and 8GB of GDDR5 RAM. While less powerful than current PS5, PS4 was a significant step up from the PS3 generation bringing capabilities like improved graphics, faster load times and new features. An upgraded 4K capable PS4 Pro version was also released in 2016.
### PS4 Library
With over 4,500 titles released spanning all genres, the PS4 library is massive and there is no shortage of great games to play. Top exclusives found only on PlayStation consoles helped drive sales like God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Spider-Man, Bloodborne, The Last of Us Remastered/Part II and more. The number of games sold across both physical and digital formats totals over 774 million copies as of January 2023, showing the longevity and popularity of the PS4 platform.
### Moving to Next Gen
Since launching in November 2020, the PlayStation 5 has rapidly gained momentum as the new flagship console from Sony. With powerful specs allowing for true 4K resolution and ray tracing capabilities, most new AAA multiplatform titles are starting to shift development focus over to PS5/Xbox Series consoles. However, PS4 will continue being supported for older games and many cross-generational titles in the near future. While next gen offers the latest tech, PS4 maintains a large install base and library.
### Price Comparison  
A major deciding factor is pricing, as the PS4 is significantly more affordable than a PS5 currently. Retail prices for a new PS4 Slim can often be found around $200-300 while used or refurbished consoles go for as low as $100 on the secondary market. In comparison, the PS5 MSRP is $400-500 but units remain difficult to find in stock without paying scalped prices over $600. For the massive PS4 game library and continued support, the value is undeniable.
### PS4 vs PS5 Specifications
While less technically powerful, PS4 specs are still capable of running all but the most demanding new releases. Games like Horizon Forbidden West and the last of us Part I release on both consoles with only minor differences. PS5 offers an SSD for near-instant load times, enhanced visuals at 4K/60FPS or even 8K, as well as haptics and adaptive triggers. However, PS4 can still play virtually all of its huge library with quality performance depending on the TV. Backwards compatibility means PS4 owners aren't forced to upgrade but can when best fitted to budgets and needs. 
### Conclusion
In conclusion, while the PS5 is the top choice for the latest features and games, the PS4 remains an excellent budget option in 2023. With such a massive library of great exclusive and multiplatform titles that can provide hundreds of hours of entertainment, a used PS4 purchase won't disappoint. However, those wanting cutting edge visuals and performance from new releases may be better served waiting to invest in a PS5 once supply becomes more available and affordable. Overall, a PS4 is still highly recommended for its immense value, but PS5 adoption will accelerate over the coming years.
