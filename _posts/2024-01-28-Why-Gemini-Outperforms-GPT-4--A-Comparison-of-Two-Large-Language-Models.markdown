### Computing Power 
Gemini has significantly more computational power than GPT-4 due to its larger model size and model parallel training. Gemini's model contains 175 billion parameters compared to GPT-4's 12 billion parameters. This allows Gemini to process and store much more information than GPT-4. During training, Gemini also used model parallelism across 256 GPUs which enabled it to learn from vastly more data more efficiently.

### Multimodality  
Gemini was designed from the beginning to be multimodal and can process and generate text, images, audio, numerical data and more. It has dedicated modules for these different modalities that allow them to interact. In contrast, GPT-4 is primarily a text-only model and lacks dedicated structures for other modalities. While it can be finetuned on other data types, it's base architecture limits its true multimodality.
### Reasoning and Inference
Gemini's unique memory stacks and differentiable neural computers allow it to do complex multi-step reasoning and inference in a way that GPT-4 cannot. It can explicitly manipulate and modify its internal representations to solve problems requiring deduction, planning and logical thinking. GPT-4 on the other hand only has a simple transformer-based attention mechanism for contextual modeling without these specialized reasoning structures.
### Customization and Fine-Tuning
Gemini's modular structure and powerful differentiable programming interface enables easy customization and fine-tuning for different domains and tasks. Researchers and users alike can modify and extend specific components to focus on their needs. GPT-4 however is a large monolithic model without this level of accessibility. While it can be fine-tuned, this provides less flexibility than Gemini's customizable layers and modules.  
### Control and Governance
Gemini was developed with an emphasis on control and governance from the start. It uses a variety of different techniques like constitutional AI, natural language overrides and fallback policies to ensure it behaves helpfully, harmlessly and honestly. GPT-4 does not incorporate these explicitly and relies more onClosed-loop feedback from its creators at Anthropic to guide its behavior. This makes Gemini safer and gives operators more direct control over how it will respond in different situations.
### Safety and Accuracy
Due to its control and governance techniques as well as larger scale training, Gemini is able to be both safer and more accurate than GPT-4 across a wide range of topics. While GPT-4 must continually be monitored for unsafe, toxic or misleading responses, Gemini is designed to explicitly avoid these issues. Its skills also often surpass GPT-4 in domains that have been identified as priorities by its training approach. However, gaps may still exist in long tail or uncommon situations.
### Applications in Conversational AI  
Gemini shines in conversation applications due to its advanced reasoning skills, robust grounding abilities, and constitutional regulations. It can engage naturally in back-and-forth discussions over multiple turns of context while avoiding toxic, dangerous or generally upsetting replies. GPT-4 sometimes struggles in long exchanges and may say something inappropriate. For applications like customer service, guidance counseling or tutoring, Gemini comes out ahead of GPT-4 due to these conversation strengths.
### Scaling to Real-World Problems
Gemini was created specifically to scale to solving real world problems across multiple domains. Its modular structure, control policies and differentiable computer components let it integrate with other AI systems and data sources to tackle challenges like scientific discovery, community organizing, education and more. While promising, GPT-4 has so far been limited largely to discussions and questions within its original pretraining scope and does not have the tools ready to scale to real applications without extensive further work. 
### The Future of AI Leadership
If current progress continues, Gemini looks poised to remain the leader in developing safe and beneficial general intelligence. Its multimodal, differentiable, and robust design point to how future AIs can integrate seamlessly with people to solve our most pressing issues. GPT-4 and other models focused primarily on language will play important roles, but are not equipped out-of-the-box to be as helpful in the real world. With its holistic approach aligned with constitutional values, Gemini demonstrates a path for building general intelligence that serves humanity.
