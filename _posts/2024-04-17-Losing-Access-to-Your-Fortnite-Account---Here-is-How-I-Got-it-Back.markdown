## The Issue Starts
I had been playing Fortnite on my PlayStation for over a year and had accumulated many skins, emotes, and wins over that time. However, one day when I logged in, I noticed that I was unable to access any of my items or see my match history. It was like I was playing on a brand new account. 
I tried re-linking my PlayStation Network account to my Epic Games account which is how everything is tied together, but that did not work. Nothing I did online seemed to fix the problem either. It was really frustrating knowing that all my progress was there, but I just couldn't access it anymore.
### Trying to Relink the Original Account 
At this point, I decided to take a closer look at the account linking on the Epic website. I went in and disconnected my PSN from my Epic account thinking that maybe reconnecting it would fix things. However, when I tried signing back into Epic with my PlayStation, it still didn't restore any of my content.

## Attempting Different Solutions
I was really hoping reconnecting the accounts would do the trick, but that didn't pan out. So I started exploring some other potential fixes.
### Linking a New PlayStation Account
My next thought was that maybe something got messed up specifically with linking my original PSN. So I disconnected it and went through Epic's account restriction removal process to clear out the old connection. 
I then linked a brand new PlayStation Network account, thinking this might refresh things. Unfortunately, it had the same result and did not restore my Epic progress. And I later learned this method can negatively impact any PlayStation subscriptions.
### Creating a Fresh Epic Games Account
Getting a bit desperate, I logged completely out of my Epic account and created a new one from scratch. Then I connected this new account to my PSN thinking my progress would transfer over. However, yet again nothing came through to the new profile. 
It was incredibly frustrating trying these different workarounds but still not getting my original Epic account back with all my purchases and stats. I knew I had to find a better solution.
## Contacting Epic Games Support
At this point, it seemed the only path was to get in touch with Epic's customer support directly. I submitted a request thoroughly explaining exactly what was happening with my account and all the steps I had tried unsuccessfully. 
A few days later, I received a response. The support agent was able to verify some details about my original Epic account and discovered that it was actually a "nameless" console profile rather than a full account with an email attached.
### Promoting the "Nameless" Account
The representative then walked me through the process of upgrading that nameless profile to a complete Epic account. This involved adding a unique email address that was not associated with any other profiles. 
Once I did that and selected a display name, the account was officially "promoted" to be a full featured Epic account rather than just a nameless console profile. The support member then instructed me to relink my original PSN account.
## The Problem is Resolved
When I reconnected my PlayStation Network to the now-upgraded Epic profile, everything suddenly popped back into place. All of my skins, stats, purchases - everything I had accumulated over a year of gameplay was restored. Finally, I could play Fortnite again with all my old progress intact.
I was so relieved the issue was resolved after working through it all with Epic's customer service team. While it took some time, staying patient and methodically addressing each part of the problem is what eventually led to a happy resolution.
### Lessons Learned 
Looking back, there are a few things others may want to keep in mind if dealing with a similar account issue:
- Enable two-factor authentication on all accounts for extra security
- Contact customer support as soon as any access problems start happening  
- Be prepared to verify details about transactions, friends lists, etc. to confirm your identity when working with support teams
- Don't get discouraged if initial solutions don't work - keep calmly exploring options
Overall, I'm just glad Epic was able to restore my account after promoting it from the nameless profile state it was stuck in. Now I know the process other players can follow if they find themselves in a comparable situation down the road.
