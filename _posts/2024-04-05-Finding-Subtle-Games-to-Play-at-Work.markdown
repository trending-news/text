## Old Text Adventures  
These classic games only require text on the screen, making them easy to quickly minimize if a supervisor walks by. One such game is the built-in Dunnet text adventure in the Emacs text editor. Emacs allows for fast buffer switching which comes in handy for playing games discreetly at work. Dunnet provides a simplistic adventure that doesn't require graphics, allowing it to be played subtly. With just a few keystrokes, one could switch from code to the game and back again without their boss ever knowing.
## Making Believable AI Stories
Telling stories through interactive fiction programs can fool coworkers into thinking real work is being done. One such program is Eliza, a classic natural language processing program from the 1960s that conducts a psychotherapy session. While the responses may seem primitive now, in a brief interaction someone not paying close attention might be convinced real work discussions are occurring. Demonstrating simple AI programs to colleagues can spread the impression that productive tasks are the focus, while still providing a subtle distraction from tedious work. 
## Stealth Gameplay Without Mouse Movement
Many managers monitor employees by watching cursor movement more than specific programs used. One game ideal for stealthy workplace play is the space Western rogue-like Duskers. The entire game can be controlled solely through keyboard commands to remotely pilot drones through abandoned spaceships. With no mouse clicks needed, it allows furtive gameplay that won't catch unwanted attention. The dark atmospheric setting and focus on exploration through simple drone commands also keeps screen content discreet and unlikely to arouse suspicion from possible onlookers.
### Summary of Duskers  
At first glance controlling small drones to explore long-abandoned spaceships through basic text commands seems simplistic. However, Duskers provides meaningful decisions and strategic thinking as stealth and reconnaissance become increasingly important when facing unknown threats. Carefully deploying probe drones to scout ahead and remotely operate salvage drones requires planning and coordination. The unique gameplay loop of discovering more of the detailed pixel art world through subtle exploration keeps the atmosphere tense. Duskers offers an absorbing distraction without flashy graphics that could disrupt productivity.

## BTD Games on Restricted Networks
Bloons Tower Defense has been a popular multiplayer strategy defense game for over a decade across multiple versions and platforms. The animated style remains visually simple enough to not draw attention even on a work computer. Several installments also run easily even on restricted corporate networks with limited access. Playing cooperative or competitive multiplayer matches against colleagues enhances the fun, even if it has to be done discreetly without supervision noticing. Setting up private matches allows playing together subtly during lunch or slower periods.
## Competition Hinders Collaboration  
While competition can be entertaining in games, viewing coworkers as opponents to outperform can negatively impact the workplace dynamic. Such a mindset discourages collaboration and bonding, undermining overall team performance. Casual subtle games at work should focus more on comradery than one-upping colleagues. Lighthearted gaming together can build rapport if the emphasis stays on cooperation over competition that seeds discord. The goal remains productive work, so games require balance as casual complements, not distracting priorities that damage professionalism and productivity. 
## Halo Custom Edition LAN Play  
For those working in an office environment with others nearby, one appealing option is owning an older version of Halo that supports local area networking (LAN) multiplayer between computers in close proximity. Halo Custom Edition from the early 2000s has minimal hardware requirements by today's standards, making it possible to engage in multiplayer matches discreetly alongside colleagues. Setting up private "LAN parties" over the lunch break provides a subtle bonding experience and friendly competition among coworkers. Just ensure audio stays muted and any on-screen violence won't offend more conservative colleagues.
### Mobile Games For Brief Sessions  
Phones provide a convenient way to sneak in short gaming sessions practically anywhere without needing a full computer. One mobile title that supports both online and local offline multiplayer is the zombie tower defense game SAS Zombie Assault 4. The arcade style of zapping monsters in contained military bases translates well to touch screens. Creating private matches allows discreet gameplay even during brief work breaks without an internet connection. Its smooth performance on phones allows killing a few minutes to refresh without disrupting longer work tasks.
## Burnout Leads to Lengthy Distraction 
When repetitive tasks or difficult periods at work lead to burnout and exhaustion, the temptation grows to escape into lengthy games. However, games requiring an hour or more commitment remain inadvisable for most professional settings. More appropriate options focus on portable quick sessions or classics involving strategy without time limits like chess or rummy. While relaxation benefits well-being, discretion stays key so gameplay doesn't undermine one's job or disrupt colleagues. Overall, mild subtle games provide a healthy outlet when used judiciously as complements to productive work, not replacements that enable slacking off.
