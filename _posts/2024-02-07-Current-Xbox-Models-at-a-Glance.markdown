The original Xbox One from 2013 is showing its age and struggles with newer games. While the console is still usable, upgrading could provide benefits like improved performance. The Xbox One S improves on the original with support for 4K video and HDR, a smaller form factor, and lower energy usage. It's a good upgrade choice for existing One owners looking to get the most from their games and media. However, the most powerful current-gen console is the Xbox One X. It offers true 4K gaming that isn't available on the One S. It's a better choice for those focused on visual fidelity, but the benefits depend on having a 4K TV. 
### The New Xbox Series Consoles
Microsoft's next-gen consoles provide powerful upgrades from their predecessors. The Xbox Series S is a lower-cost option for 1080p gaming. It has a faster processor and solid state drive for quicker loading, as well as enhanced graphics over the One X. As an entry point into the new generation, it delivers great value. Meanwhile, the Series X is the most powerful system available with the ability to output games at 4K resolution up to 120 frames per second. It's ideal for those wanting the best possible visual experience, albeit at a higher price point.

### Choosing Between Current and Next Gen Models  
Existing One owners can skip the One S upgrade unless they want 4K video and HDR support. They're better off enjoying their current library before investing in new hardware. One X owners may see limited benefits from the Series S due to its lower horsepower. The Series X provides a true generational leap in graphics and compatibility. New console gamers have an affordable entry with the Series S or a premium option with the Series X, both of which are future-proof investments over older systems.
### Game Compatibility and Backwards Compatibility
Most Xbox One games will carry over and get boosts on Series hardware through backwards compatibility. Exclusives may release first on next-gen before being ported to old consoles. Next-gen exclusives likely won't appear in force until 2023-2024 as developers focus on new tech. Current systems can still deliver great gaming, and Xbox Game Pass spans platforms so your library isn't left behind. Digital purchases transfer between generations as well.
### Additional Considerations When Upgrading
Be sure your TV supports the 4K and HDR features needed to get the most from a new Xbox. An display upgrade may also be necessary. Storage is another factor - higher capacity solid state drives can enhance the experience over time as they become more affordable. Weigh priorities between load times, performance, and visual fidelity too, as the Series S excels at the former while the X maximizes graphics.
### When is the Right Time to Upgrade?
It's best to wait for first price drops or exclusive next-gen titles before making the jump from current to new systems. Early adopters pay the highest costs. The One X remains potent if multiplats are your focus; enjoy the remainder of the generation. Your budget and library transition should also factor into timing decisions. There's no urgent need unless you want cutting-edge power immediately.
### Conclusion - Choosing the Optimal Console  
Carefully consider needs, display, owned content, and budget to decide the best upgrade path - whether that means sticking with current hardware, buying next-gen, or waiting. Overall enjoyment, not just raw specs, should guide your choice between capable machines. Focus spending on great games rather than always chasing the latest tech, as you can have fun across Microsoft's ecosystem.
