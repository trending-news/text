Online multiplayer gaming has become incredibly popular in recent years with the rise of competitive esports titles and battle royale games bringing communities of players together around the world. However, as someone who grew up playing story-driven single player games, I've found that online multiplayer simply doesn't offer the type of gaming experience I prefer. While I can appreciate the social and competitive aspects that attract so many to these games, for me they often detract from what I find most enjoyable about gaming. In this post I will explore some of the key reasons why I prefer solo gaming over multiplayer online experiences.
### Toxic Behavior Ruins the Fun
One of the biggest turnoffs of online multiplayer for me is dealing with toxic behavior from other players. Whether it's trash talking, bullying, or just general rudeness, the anonymity the internet provides seems to bring out the worst in some. You never know what kind of attitude or language you might encounter from random teammates or opponents. The competitive nature of many multiplayer games also breeds arrogance and poor sportsmanship. I game to relax and have fun, not get stressed out by jerks. The socially isolating single player experience spares me these nonsense social interactions.

### Immersion Takes a Back Seat 
What I love most about games is being fully immersed in rich fictional worlds with deep narratives and characters. However, the very social and competitive nature of online multiplayer prevents this type of engrossment. Voices and random conversations in voice chat, emotes and sprays, the constant metagaming - it all serves as a distraction that breaks immersion. In single player I can get completely lost in the story and world without these outside distractions. Complex stories and deep narratives also tend to take a back seat to fast paced competitive gameplay in most online titles. 
### Spontaneity is Limited
Another downside to online multiplayer is the lack of flexibility and spontaneity compared to single player games. I enjoy being able to quickly jump into a game for a few minutes or hours at a time depending on my schedule. But with multiplayer you have to dedicate fixed blocks to group activities or risk leaving teammates hanging. Real life responsibilities also tend to interrupt at inopportune times online, like having to step away mid match. Pausing simply isn't an option. The casual solo experience allows me to play flexibly on my own schedule.
### Meta Gaming Feels Like a Second Job
Keeping up with the meta in competitive online games often feels more like a job than a hobby. You constantly need to adjust your playstyle, characters, and strategies to fit the narrow range of what's competitively viable according to the masses. Everything else is deemed "non-meta" or off-meta and frowned upon. I'd rather just play games for fun without worrying if my character is rated highly enough on some tier list. The balancing challenges of multiplayer also mean a character or strategy you loved last season may now be deemed broken next season. 
### scheduling Gatherings is Difficult  
Even for cooperative multiplayer, setting up regular group play sessions with friends can be challenging. Real life schedules for working adults are busy and conflicting. You can't always reliably count on others being available at the same times. The casual solo gaming experience means I face no such scheduling or availability constraints. I'm also more of an introvert who prefers solo activities as recharging alone time after work or social obligations. Forced socially coordinating doesn't appeal when gaming is meant as down time.
### Too Much Social Energy Drain
Which ties into another reason I prefer solo gaming - the effort required for social interaction in multiplayer is simply more draining than relaxing alone. As an introvert, being "on" socially for voice chat even with friends can feel like work rather than relaxation after a long day. Solo games provide a low effort way for me to unwind without commitments to others. I appreciate being able to quietly immerse alone in stress free surroundings. The competitive multiplayer scene too can become stressful rather than stress relieving over time. 
### Stepping Away Improves Perspective
Negative emotions easily build up playing competitive online games due to the toxicities mentioned. But there's no stepping away or taking breaks like in single player if things go south attitudinally or performance wise. Pausing avoids tilting and gives time to cool off or get perspective. Coming back after fresh air often improves enjoyment and attitude towards the game. The solo gaming experience affords this flexibility that improves overall well being and relationship with games over the long run.
In conclusion, while I appreciate communities and competition online games provide others, the core reasons I've always preferred solo gaming over multiplayer are the creative storytelling, deep worlds and characters, casual flexible format, and ability to recharge solo as needed. Pausing, breaking immersion less, facing fewer social stresses, and generally playing simply for fun rather than success make the solo experience highly preferable as gaming is a relaxing hobby for me first and foremost. That said, I still look forward to the occasional local multiplayer fun with friends when schedules permit a fun social experience without toxicity. Overall my gaming preferences will likely remain story and character driven single player titles.
