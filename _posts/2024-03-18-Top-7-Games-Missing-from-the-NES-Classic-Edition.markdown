The NES Classic Edition was a fun trip down memory lane, revisiting 30 classic NES titles on a plug-and-play console. However, there were still many beloved games left off the system. Here are 7 games that deserved a spot on the NES Classic.
### A Remastered Mario Collection 
Super Mario All-Stars was a collection of the first three Super Mario Bros. games, remastered for the SNES with graphical enhancements like updated sprites and color palettes. While the original NES versions were included on the Classic, the SNES remakes brought improvements like redesigned worlds and bonus content. All-Stars remastered these iconic platformers for a new generation of players with 16-bit visuals. It was a missed opportunity not to bring these sharper Mario experiences to the NES Classic.

### Creative Painting and Music 
Mario Paint let players unleash their creativity beyond standard platforming. Its unique art studio and music modes let kids design pictures and compose songs using the SNES mouse and bundled cartridges. The mini-games were also zany fun, like battling flying insects. Mario Paint showed gaming could be about expression, not just skill-based gameplay. Its odd yet beloved experimentation would have added variety among the NES Classic's classic-focused library. 
### Galactic Run-and-Gun Action
Super Star Wars was a faithful adaptation of the original Star Wars film. Players ran, jumped and shot their way through recognizable locations and enemy encounters pulled straight from the movies. Its challenging side-scrolling shooter action made battling Stormtroopers and outmaneuvering walkers feel cinematic. While licensing issues may have prevented its inclusion, Super Star Wars represented the series well and could have thrilled classic Star Wars fans with a nostalgic addition.
### Diddy's Mine Cart Adventures
Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest took Rare's already impressive DKC gameplay to new heights. Characters like Diddy and new friend Dixie brought fresh energy. Its lush jungle environments were packed with secrets. But nothing compared to the rush of its famously difficult mine cart levels, weaving through peril at breakneck speeds. Considered one of the greatest platformers ever made, DKC2's inclusion would have fittingly represented the SNES era for the NES Classic. 
### A Classic Zelda Adventure
The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past took the original Zelda's top-down structure and perfected it. Its vivid, interconnected Overworld was filled with mysteries to uncover. Classes like merchants and thieves populated towns. But its ever-engrossing story of light and shadow, told through minimal but masterful storytelling, made A Link to the Past a landmark game. Known for pioneering conventions still used in modern Zelda games, its absence on the NES Classic was a missed opportunity to introduce newcomers to a genre-defining classic.
### Memorable RPG Characters
Final Fantasy VI had everything players loved about the job-based FF experience but amplified. Its diverse, fully-voiced cast like moral-conflicted assassin Celes and wildly ambitious villain Kefka made the story compelling and profound. With 16-bit era visuals pushing SNES boundaries, FFVI crafted an epic tale that still inspires creative works today. Its mature themes, gameplay innovations, and timeless storyline cemented it as the pinnacle of SNES RPGs. More people deserved a chance to experience why FFVI remains revered. 
### Run-and-Gun Mayhem
Few franchises captured "run-and-gun" arcade energy better than Contra. Contra III: The Alien Wars took the side-scrolling shooting formula and pushed it further. New modes like vehicle sections kept levels fresh. Players now had multiple paths to take. Fan favorites Bill and Lance returned along with thrilling alien designs. But Contra III truly innovated with its mid-mission weapon upgrades, rewarding skillful players with new firepower. Its creative refinements made it a standout in the acclaimed series that deserved to be experienced on the NES Classic.
In the end, while 30 games hit the nostalgia sweet spot for many, the NES Classic Edition left worthy titles on the sidelines. Games like Super Mario All-Stars, Mario Paint, Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and more brought creativity, beloved franchises, and innovative qualities that expanded beyond the NES's core first-party focus. Their absence was a missed opportunity for newcomers learning gaming's history.
