### Legality of Selling Retro Games
Selling pirated games is strictly prohibited under copyright law. Legally, you are allowed to sell retro games if you own the license from the original IP holder or if the game is in the public domain with expired copyright. However, some older games from companies that no longer exist can be tricky to determine clear ownership status. If you can prove previous legal ownership of the game through things like receipts, you are typically able to sell reproductions as well.

### Selling Licensed and Emulated Games 
Modern services that offer retro games through emulation, like those available on Walmart gaming services, have obtained proper licensing from the original publishers. Digital storefronts such as Steam also ensure emulation is done legally through licensing agreements. Selling individual games through emulation without such licensing can violate copyright. 
### Games in Public Domain
For some of the earliest video games created before modern copyright law solidified in the late 1970s and early 80s, the copyright may have expired allowing unlimited reproduction and sales. However, accurately determining if a specific game has fully entered public domain status can be a complex legal process individuals are not equipped to fully research without attorney assistance. 
### Games Without Clear Ownership 
When original game developers and publishers dissolve operations or go out of business entirely, the ownership status of their catalog of games may remain ambiguous. Pursuing sales of such games with uncertain copyright holders risks potential legal challenges down the road without comprehensive research and documentation of rights. Collaborating with academic institutions could help enable continued preservation and study of historically significant yet obscure games.
### Enabling Preservation of Obscure Games
Despite unclear ownership status, in rare cases sales of reproductions may still be permitted under legal exemptions if the game is deemed culturally, historically or scientifically important but otherwise impossible for scholars and fans to access in its original form. Teaming with vintage gaming organizations or museums focused on video game preservation could help build such arguments to allow continued existence of otherwise lost software titles.  
### International Copyright Variances
International copyright law differs depending on the specific treaties and statutes each country has signed or enacted. Several nations are not signatories to global copyright agreements like the influential Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. Additionally, restrictions may apply regarding export of certain games depending on policies from their region of original manufacture during the applicable copyright term. Thorough research is needed regarding international rights for games intended to be sold abroad.
### Consulting Legal Advice is Key
Due to the complexities involved with retro software copyright, determining clear ownership rights and sales legality is extremely difficult for non-expert individuals to evaluate definitively without an attorney with relevant IP expertise. Consultation with an entertainment or technology lawyer is highly recommended before pursuing significant sales to prevent potential legal jeopardy down the road. Professional counsel can also advise on proper documentation practices to protect resellers.
### Carefully Assessing Collection Value
Taking a full inventory of your retro game and console collection with detailed notes on condition and included items is necessary to fairly price items for sale. Research recently sold "comps" on platforms such as PriceCharting to understand current market value trends. Factor in rarity, demand, editions, and overall quality to optimize price competitiveness for sought-after collectibles while still pricing more common titles at reasonable levels consumers will find appealing. 
### Strategies for Successful Sales
Online marketplaces like eBay remain hugely popular for trading classic gaming gear but dedicated retro gaming sites can also attract collectors. Photos showcasing item and package condition are important. Carefully bubble wrap, box individually, and insure shipments while accepting payment securely through trusted providers. Respond promptly to questions and address issues respectfully to build positive customer reputation.
