## Why Game Updates are Important
Game updates are released to fix bugs, issues and exploits that are discovered after the initial game release. This improves the overall gameplay experience. Game developers are constantly finding ways to optimize performance and combat cheaters online. Keeping your games up to date ensures you experience the best possible version. 
Updates also add valuable new content and features over the lifetime of popular games. Developers support their titles with extra maps, modes, characters and weapons added through free updates. Missing updates means missing out on all the new adventures and additions created after a game's launch. 
Finally, online multiplayer requires all players to be on the same update version. Without updating, you can't participate in the live online community. Co-op and competitive modes won't work if other users have access to content and tweaks you're missing out on. Staying up to date is crucial for enjoying all the network features in online titles.
## Downloading Updates
The PlayStation 4 has useful options to help with downloading updates easily. Putting your console into rest mode allows downloads and installations to continue in the background. This prevents wasting time staring at a progress bar. You'll wake up to find your games nicely updated.
Being close to your router also speeds up downloads over WiFi. 5GHz networks have less interference than 2.4GHz, so try that band if available. Pausing large downloads and resuming later can help too if your connection seems unstable. Breaking it into chunks avoids getting stuck halfway through. 
Of course, internet speed is key. Faster services mean quicker updating. But you have options to optimize even on slower connections. Understanding how downloads work on PS4 helps you keep games current with less hassle.
### Playing without Updates
While it's possible to play offline without installing updates, it's generally not recommended. Games launched in this state contain bugs, glitches and flaws addressed later on through patching. You'll encounter known issues others haven't seen in a long time.
You also miss out on optimized performance and balancing introduced in later updates. Developers continue tweaking elements like frame rates, load times and even difficulty after release based on player feedback. Missing updates means missing out on these refinements. 
Any online or cooperative modes simply won't function at all without being on the most up-to-date version. Expansions and downloadable content often have network integration as well, requiring you match theLive Service version. Not updating cuts you off from the online community elements in many titles.

### Updating Process
Fortunately, the PlayStation 4 makes updating games straightforward. Whenever you insert a disc for a game that needs updating, it will automatically check for and install any waiting patches in the background. You can override this and start the game unpatched if you really want, but online play won't work as mentioned before.
The system is also clever about installing updates even when games arenâ€™t running. Any time the PS4 connects online, it will quietly seek out and download new patches for your installed software titles in preparation. The next time you launch a game, it will already be fully up to date without wasting extra time. Updating happens seamlessly in the background thanks to Sony's thoughtful system design.
### Putting the PS4 in Rest Mode 
Rest mode helps downloads, updates and charging continue even while the console is powered off from the front-end. To access this handy low-power state, simply press and hold the PlayStation button on your controller to open the quick menu. Select "Enter Rest Mode" at the bottom of the list, and the PS4 will power down non-essential components while keeping network connectivity alive. This optimized standby setting lets updates complete without draining batteries idling on the home screen. A swift press of the PlayStation button then launches you instantly into the latest game versions on demand.
### Reasons to Update Your System
Beyond keeping individual games optimized and online-enabled, periodically updating your PlayStation 4 system software itself delivers benefits too. Regular patches add new system-wide features, fixes bugs, and improves overall stability and performance. Staying current ensures you access each new capability and enhancement as Sony rolls them out. 
Security is another key reason to timely install system updates. Regularly patching potential exploits and vulnerabilities helps protect your console and account from the latest online threats. A out-of-date PS4 poses unnecessary risk compared to one ensured to have the most up-to-front software protections in place.
Overall efficiency gains as well, as developers squeeze out further optimizations with each build. Load times, multitasking responsiveness and energy consumption all tend to improve over time as Sony refines the operating system based on usage data. There's no good reason not to take a few minutes to keep your system software in tip-top shape with simple regular updates.
## Summary
In conclusion, keeping PlayStation 4 games, system software and online services updated is highly recommended. It ensures you benefit from all the improvements, fixes and new additions developers continue supporting titles with. Rest mode lets downloads complete seamlessly when convenient. While not mandatory, skipping updates means missing out on invaluable enhancements and risks bugs, incompatibility or security vulnerabilities as software evolves. Take a few minutes to stay current and fully enjoy your PlayStation library at its best.
