## Getting Hooked on CoC
### Discovering the Game
I first discovered Clash of Clans in early 2014 through an advertisement on another mobile game I was playing. The colorful graphics and castle building immediately caught my eye. I downloaded the game and soon found myself logging in multiple times a day to upgrade my base and raid other players villages.

### Addiction Takes Hold
Within a couple months, Clash of Clans had taken over much of my free time. I was constantly checking in to request troops for wars and rush upgrades. Late at night I would find myself still playing, unable to pull myself away. My friends started telling me I was obsessed. While I knew they had a point, I just couldn't stop. The progression and strategy of the game kept me hooked.
## First Attempts to Quit
### Realizing It Was Too Much
After about a year of heavy Clashing, I realized I was spending far too much time on the game. It was negatively impacting my productivity and social life. I decided a break was needed to get my priorities back in order. I made the difficult choice to delete the app from my phone.
### Relapsing After 7 Months 
For 7 months, I stayed away from Clash of Clans successfully. However, one day I saw an ad for an update and curiosity got the best of me. I redownloaded the game, telling myself I would just check it out casually. Within a week I was back to my old addictive habits. Quitting proved much harder than I had expected.
## Rising up the Ranks as a Great Attacker
### Returning With a Resolution
The second time around, I returned to CoC with the goal of playing moderately instead of compulsively farming. I decided to focus on improving my attacking strategies to help our clan in wars rather than mindlessly upgrading my base. 
### Becoming a Top Attacker
Through dedicated practice of different army compositions against clanmates, my attacking skills quickly advanced. Soon I was three starring max level th9 and th10 bases with regularity. My clan came to rely on me as a top performer in wars. While I still farmed daily, it was now to help others rather than just myself.
## Founding My Own Clan  
### Struggling to Get Started
After a year of competitive warring, my friend and I decided to branch out on our own. We created a new clan with just a few members to begin with. It was challenging to recruit players and win early wars with such a small roster.
### Growing Through Dedication  
We committed to constant clan activities, donations and fair play to build our reputation. Over several months, we advanced our own bases to TH9 and expanded our skills. Slowly more members joined and we started winning more significant wars. Within a year the clan had grown to over 100 members and achieved level 9 status.
## Another Attempt to Quit
### Feeling Burned Out
By this point, Clash of Clans had consumed several years of my spare time. While I still enjoyed the gameplay, the daily grind was becoming exhausting. I felt burned out from the constant warring and wanted a significant break for the first time. 
### Permanently Deleting My Account
I made the tough choice to permanently say goodbye to my beloved max TH10 base. I gifted it to my younger cousin who had just started playing. Deleting the app and signing out of Game Center felt bittersweet but like a weight had been lifted. I was ready to fully move on.
## Cousin Destroys My Hard Work
### Base in Ruins 
Within a week, I received an alarming call from my cousin. He tearfully informed me that someone had gotten into his account and destroyed my old base, removing all the decorations. All my hard work upgrading over years was undone.
### Base in Shambles
Even worse, without my guidance, my cousin had upgraded the town hall to TH10 without properly upgrading defenses first. The newly added inferno towers completely threw off our clan's war matchmaking. My base was left in shambles, both visually and strategically. 
## Returning as a Shadow of My Former Self
### Rebuilding From Rubble  
With no choice but to start fresh, I recovered my old rushed TH10 base. It was humbling to see all the defenses several levels below what they should be. I resolutely began the long, grinding process of catching it back up through regular farming.
### Goals of Competing Again
My main motivation was to eventually take part in clan wars at a high level once more. However, it was clear I had lost a step in my attacking skills during my break. I was no longer considered one of the best within my clan. Returning felt bittersweet as a shadow of my peak raiding days.
## The Declining Interests of an Old Gamer  
### Passion Fades Over Time
While I kept logging on daily, my enthusiasm and performance gradually continued slipping. Raiding became more of a chore than a joy. Newer, more engaging mobile games started pulling my interest elsewhere.
### Moving On From Clash
These days I play Clash of Clans very casually if at all. My base still exists but sits mostly idle. It seems my years as a top raider are now behind me. For better or worse, my long journey with Clash of Clans is nearing its end as the interests of this old gamer drift elsewhere.
