### Current capabilities and early warnings
An asteroid over 1000km diameter impacting Earth is incredibly unlikely based on current detection capabilities. With more than 95% of near-Earth asteroids over 1km monitored through surveys like Spaceguard, such a large asteroid would not go unnoticed for the 18 days before impact as described in doomsday scenarios. Modern technology allows us to detect potential threats decades in advance and track their trajectories to determine the real risk they pose to our planet.

### Unimaginable destruction
However, if an asteroid of that immense size were to somehow avoid early detection and strike Earth, the devastation would be unparalleled. Estimates show the impact would release an energy tens of thousands of times more powerful than the entire global nuclear arsenal. The surface of the planet would liquefy and the oceans boil away instantly. Massive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions would turn the remaining land into molten glass. No life on the surface would survive such an apocalyptic event.
### Shaping Earth's early history 
During the formation of the solar system billions of years ago, the young Earth endured several enormous impacts from planetary embryos and planetesimals left over from its creation. One collision is thought to have blasted material skyward that coalesced into the Moon. These violent giant impacts helped determine the composition and orientation of our planet. Though devastating locally, they played a key role in making Earth habitable in the long run. 
###Monitoring threats for the future  
Space agencies now monitor over 95% of the largest near-Earth asteroids through survey programs. No known impacts of 10km or greater are predicted for at least the next two centuries based on current tracking data. Continued observation allows us to build a more detailed picture of Earth's cosmic neighborhood and better assess the true risk posed by different sized objects. This improved understanding helps determine the best strategies for deflecting potential threats detected decades from impact.
###Testing deflection techniques
Several non-nuclear options exist to alter an asteroid's path including kinetic impactors, gravity tractors, and laser ablation. NASA's upcoming DART mission plans to demonstrate the kinetic impactor method by colliding with the asteroid Dimorphos to subtly change its orbit around a larger asteroid. If an actual impact threat is ever detected, missions like DART may prove such deflection techniques viable to safely reroute asteroids endangering Earth.
###Surviving smaller but still catastrophic impacts  
While an asteroid the size of Texas would result in a 100% extinction event, impacts from objects a few kilometers in diameter could still devastate the planet but potentially leave some life hanging on. The short term effects of even a 10km impact would be globally catastrophic, boiling the oceans for over a year and destroying most ecosystems. Deeper rock shelters or underground locations might offer refuges for microscopic survivors to eventually re-emerge.
###Tracing a quieter future  
Computer modeling suggests the early bombardment phase that shaped Earth ended around 700 million years after the solar system's birth as gravitational interactions expelled most large objects. The inner solar system has since stabilized, creating a more serene environment for life to evolve uninterrupted for billions of years. While smaller impacts remain an ongoing risk, civilization today can take comfort that events on the scale described in apocalyptic fiction are exceedingly unlikely for hundreds of millions of years to come.
