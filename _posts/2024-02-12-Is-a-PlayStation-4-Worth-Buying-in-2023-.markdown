## ### Sony has committed to supporting the PS4 through 2025
While the PlayStation 4 launched in late 2013, Sony continues supporting the aging console with new first and third-party releases. Though nearing the end of its lifespan, the PS4 will see at least one more year of major exclusive and multiplatform games through 2025. This extends the potential value and gameplay hours one can get from the system. 
Recent PS4 titles in 2022 like Horizon Forbidden West and Gran Turismo 7 showed the console is still capable of excellent visuals. Even if graphics are inferior to current PS5 versions, they remain quite good for a system entering its tenth year. With committed support through the next two years, plenty more quality experiences are in the pipeline.

## ### Alternatives for entertainment exist, but PS4 remains best for gaming
If primarily seeking a device for Blu-ray playback or basic streaming, cheaper options like Roku or Apple TV suffice. However, the PlayStation 4 remains the most cost-effective way to enjoy modern gaming. Building a capable gaming PC requires a significant investment, while current-gen consoles remain difficult to find or expensive due to shortages. 
As an all-in-one entertainment system, the PS4 serves movies, shows, music and games from one box. And its broad software library expands enjoyment far beyond any single-purpose streaming sticks. For the price of a bundled console and handful of games, it offers tremendous entertainment value long-term.
## ### Adjusted for inflation, the PS4 represents good value over time 
Looking at the lifespan of past PlayStation systems, the PS4 has now reached the median price point adjusted for inflation compared to its predecessors. While MSRP was $399 at launch in 2013, inflation means that price is more like $450-500 in today's dollars. Considering it provides a full decade of gaming experiences, the investment compares favorably.
Additionally, the PS4 blends gaming with an array of multimedia functions from digital storefronts to audio/video apps. It serves as a hub for both interactive entertainment and passive media consumption. Exclusive franchises continue driving hardware sales by providing software ecosystems unique to the platform.
## ### Secondary markets and installments can help address supply issues
Ongoing shortages of chips and components have constrained production of new PS5 and Xbox consoles. This increases appeal of procuring a last-gen system still receiving support. Where inventory remains tight, retailers sometimes offer consoles through no-interest installment plans. 
The used game market represents another viable option, as high-quality pre-owned PS4 bundles can cost around half the launch MSRP. Digital storefronts also frequently feature deep discounts rivaling physical retailers. These alternatives make diving into the current generation of PlayStation gaming more manageable for those patient or operating with limited budgets.
## ### Backward compatibility carries value forward across generations
A major benefit of the PlayStation ecosystem is systemic backward compatibility. Not only can physical PS4 games be played on PS5 hardware, but the digital PS4 software library remains fully supported and upscaled. Additionally, a growing selection of classic PlayStation, PS2 and PS3 titles are available via the PS Store on newer consoles.
Whether owned physically or digitally, much of one's PS4 game library carries forward in value. This expands the scope of both potential gameplay and the playable software catalog without requiring separate legacy hardware. The broad range of backward compatible content is a large part of the PlayStation experience retained even after upgrading consoles.
## ### Physical vs digital tradeoffs depend on preferences and library 
An advantage to physical game discs is the ability to potentially find used copies for cheaper prices. They also allow resale later to partially recoup costs. However, digital game downloads come without the disc swapping but provide ultimate convenience. Some even receive post-launch patches for better performance than physical versions.
Overall, digital is ideal for building a portable game library accessible across multiple Sony consoles. However, physical often makes more sense for franchises published by Nintendo, where smaller file sizes mean games can take up significant storage on consoles. Preferences around space, cost, and sharing games inform the best approach on a case by case basis. 
## ### Sony exclusives continue pushing the PS4 experience 
Exclusive AAA franchises remain a core leverage of the PlayStation business and driver of console ownership. Hits over the PS4 generation like God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Spider-Man, Bloodborne, and the Last of Us franchises provided gameplay experiences unique to Sony platforms. Their acclaimed single-player narratives and gameplay innovated within genres like action-adventure.
Upcoming sequels to these worlds will further motivate upgrading to PS5. But even without, the PS4 library already includes some of this generation's most celebrated titles. Their masterful storytelling and production values offer brilliant standalone experiences for those new to PlayStation. Exclusives are a big reason to engage with the platform through its final years.    
## ### Multiplatform games cover most major releases
While exclusive franchises give Sony a distinct edge, the majority of major commercial releases target PlayStation and Xbox concurrently. Aside from Nintendo, most third-party publishers aim for as wide an audience as possible. 
The PS4 plays host to the latest multiplatform adventures from franchises like Assassin's Creed, Call of Duty, Red Dead, FIFA and more. It also caters well to Japanese role-playing games with titles from Square Enix, Bandai Namco and Atlus. Overall selection and variety remains robust despite concluding console lifecycles.
# ## Conclusion: For newcomers, PlayStation 4 delivers excellent bang for buck
Even in its twilight, the PlayStation 4 serves as an immensely capable and affordable entry point into this current generation of gaming. With continued support through 2025 and a deep software library, it provides hundreds of engaging software experiences. Both its exclusive hits and multiplatform ubiquity ensure there's always something new to play. 
Backward compatibility carries value forward, whether upgrading internally or eventually to PS5 in the future. Additionally, the used market and retailer promotions make the upfront investment quite manageable. 
For anyone yet to join the current console cycle, the PS4 empowers superb interactive entertainment and multimedia functions. Its value remains high considering lifespan, performance and exclusive software ecosystem still nourished by Sony's Worldwide Studios. It represents an excellent purchase proposition to enjoy modern gaming for years to come.
