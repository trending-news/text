### Suggesting Idle Mobile Games
Idle mobile games can be a great way to pass time on your phone without needing constant interaction. Two games I've enjoyed are Tap Titans 2 and Legend of Slime. Tap Titans 2 allows you to upgrade heroes and defeat monsters with just a tap. On stressful days, it's nice to mindlessly click away to progress. Legend of Slime caught my eye with its honest mobile game ads depicting actual gameplay. Though the game gets chaotic as your slime grows, I appreciated the transparency.

### A Favorite Idle Game
IdleOn is another idle game that continually gives you more to do the longer you play. As an avid MMO fan, I was pleasantly surprised to find this style of game on mobile. There is so much depth for an idle game, from stats and classes to bosses and raids. Though different than traditional MMOs, IdleOn scratches that itch and keeps me entertained for long sessions or quick bursts. The community is also very welcoming to new and casual players. 
### Accepting Different Tastes in Gaming  
Not every game will appeal to every person and that is perfectly fine. While I hope readers found a new idle or preferred genre to try in my suggestions, your tastes may differ. The gaming world would be rather dull if we all liked the same things. I'm just glad to share perspectives on indie favorites or classics to hopefully give someone new inspiration in their gaming. Most of all, I hope readers find fun and enjoyment however they play.
### A Dream Game Fulfilled  
For years I had heard great things about Fallout 4 but held off until I upgraded computers. When the opportunity came, I dove in and couldn't believe the depth of world-building. In my first weekend, I proudly put over 21 hours exploring the Commonwealth, completing side quests, and tinkering with crafting systems. It was everything I dreamed an open-world post-apocalyptic rpg could be.
### The Witcher 3 Steals Focus
Not wanting to rush through Fallout 4 too quickly, I browsed Steam sales and saw The Witcher 3 discounted. Though the fantasy premise didn't initially hook me, I took the chance since it was so highly rated. Little did I know I wouldn't touch Fallout 4 again for a week, completely engrossed in Geralt's story and the gorgeous open world of The Witcher 3.
### The Witcher 3 is Highly Recommended  
It's no exaggeration to say The Witcher 3 is a masterpiece of storytelling and gameplay. I was completely drawn in by the narrative threads intertwining across the map. Where I had planned to juggle between it and Fallout 4, I instead ignored my Steam backlog to focus entirely on working through questlines. If you only pick one story-rich RPG, I cannot recommend this classic enough. 
### Puzzle Game Suggestions
For something lighter than open-world epics, puzzle games offer gentle challenges that make you think without stressing over consequences. Portal still holds up as an innovative classic that plays with expectations. Braid features gorgeous hand-drawn worlds wrapped around clever mechanics tied to protagonist Jon's emotions. Bioshock Infinite also stood out for using narrative and environmental puzzles to propel its enthralling plot.
### Nostalgia for Retro Games
Looking back, some of my most beloved gaming memories come from old PC and console titles. Real-time strategy games like Age of Empires taught history while tasking you to grow empires through the ages. Role-playing games showed what stories and worlds could be crafted before expansive 3D worlds. Games like StarCraft and Baldur's Gate spent hours upon hours refining my strategy and problem-solving skills. They may show their age graphically now but the innovations and gameplay still feel ahead of their time. 
### Best Games across Genres  
To close, I'll highlight a few other genres with beloved titles. For open-world adventure, nothing beats The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and its sprawling world just begging to get lost in. Real-time tactics fans should also play Company of Heroes for its grounded WW2 setting. Whether sci-fi, indie, action or otherwise, I hope readers found some interesting new perspectives or classics to revisit in my gaming favorites across genres. Happy gaming!
