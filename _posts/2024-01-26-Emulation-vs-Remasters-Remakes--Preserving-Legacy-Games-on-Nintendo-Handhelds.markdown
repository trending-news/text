## Introduction
Emulation and remasters/remakes both aim to preserve legacy games on modern platforms like the Nintendo 3DS and Switch. However, each approach faces its own challenges. Emulation attempts to recreate the experience of original hardware but often requires significant processing power. Remasters/remakes develop new versions optimized for current systems but require extensive development time. 
This post will explore the tradeoffs between emulation and remasters/remakes for preserving classic Nintendo games on handhelds. We'll examine platform-specific emulation challenges, highlight successful remastered titles, and conclude with examples of each approach benefitting legacy game preservation.
### Challenges with Emulation 
Emulating another system's unique architecture is no simple task. Developers must reverse engineer proprietary hardware details through clean room techniques like benchmarking and simulation. Even with modern hardware, full speed emulation remains difficult due to processing overhead compared to optimized remasters.

## Game Boy Advance on 3DS
The 3DS hosted GBA games through an "Ambassador Program" emulation bundle. However, emulation faced issues with compatible sleep mode functionality. Many fans hoped the Virtual Console may offer a better GBA experience, but Nintendo opted not to emulate further.
### Super Nintendo Entertainment System on 3DS 
While the original 3DS lacked SNES horsepower, the New 3DS showed potential with a select few emulated titles. Overall, the 3DS architecture diverged too greatly from the SNES to faithfully recreate most games through emulation alone.
Remasters proved a more viable alternative, like the acclaimed Link to the Past port. However, like emulation, remastering single titles required as much effort as developing brand new games from scratch. Few saw commercial merit in such one-off projects.
### Nintendo 64 on 3DS
The 3D capabilities and raw power of the N64 posed unique obstacles for the 3DS to emulate through software. Its 32-bit RISC architecture differed substantially from the 3DS's ARM architecture. While more powerful than the SNES, the N64 remained a generation ahead of what the 3DS hardware could realistically emulate. 
Remakes offered another path but remained equally labor-intensive. With nostalgia growing for 3D titles like Ocarina of Time, remasters presented a way to preserve classics while circumventing emulation hurdles. However, the development costs remained high for any one port.
### Examples of Successful Remasters
The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds garnered widespread acclaim for how it followed A Link to the Past's formula while innovating with the series' expanding toolbox. It proved remasters need not simply regurgitate the past but could evolve beloved worlds.
Chrono Trigger's DS remake demonstrated remasters' potential to reach new audiences. While adding little in terms of new content, the port removed emulation issues that may have hindered its adoption. This helped ensure a beloved JRPG lived on for future fans. 
## Conclusion
Both emulation and remasters/remakes play vital roles in preserving legacy Nintendo games. Emulation aims to recreate authentic experiences but faces significant technical hurdles. Remasters optimize classics for new hardware yet require substantial budgets for one-off ports. 
When emulation proves infeasible, remasters circumvent its obstacles while updating favorites for modern platforms. Successful remasters like A Link Between Worlds and Chrono Trigger show the approach need not result in soulless cash-ins. Both methods benefit fans and developers alike by keeping beloved franchises accessible.
