## I. Early Years 
### Childhood Gaming
As a young child, many gamers are introduced to simple games through board books, blocks and other toddler toys. Around ages 4-6, electronic games start to become more common through consoles, handhelds and mobile games designed for young children. Puzzles, reading games, basic building and educational titles help build early problem solving skills while introducing concepts of gameplay, levels, rewards and storytelling. Most importantly, these early games spark an interest that plants the seeds for a lifetime hobby.
