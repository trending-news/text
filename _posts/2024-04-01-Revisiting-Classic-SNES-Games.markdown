SNES RPGs like EarthBound, Kirby's Super Star and Super Mario RPG allowed players to experience complex storytelling through fun gameplay. EarthBound in particular had an quirky but endearing story and soundtrack that has endured for decades. Kirby's Super Star compilation offered tons of content across different game modes for a low price. Super Mario RPG's lighthearted story collaborated well with Squaresoft's style to create a beloved classic.  
Platformers also shone on the SNES. Super Mario World maintained the fun while showcasing impressive graphical feats through its fluid animation and detailed sprite work. Donkey Kong Country pushed visuals further and even had pre-rendered 3D backgrounds years before 3D gaming took off. Both games kept platforming fresh and fun.
Fighters also evolved greatly during this era. Street Fighter II served as a landmark, refining one-on-one combat. Its various updates set standards for competitive balance in subsequent fighting games. Players spent hours learning combos and matchups to master its flashy 2D fighting.
### Exploring Rare Gems  
Some lesser discussed but still unique SNES games blended genres in new ways. Actraiser gave players the chance to build a civilization in its stimulating city-building portions. Its side-scrolling action broke things up nicely. Meanwhile, Flashback merged cinematic platforming with a futuristic noir storyline years before similar games. Underrated gems like Young Merlin and Mystical Ninja also offered offbeat adventures.
Co-op classics like Legend of the Mystical Ninja were a blast due to clever dual-character mechanics. Taking control of both ninjas simultaneously through the split-screen added clever strategic depth. Meanwhile, games like Zombies Ate My Neighbors provided endlessly replayable mayhem despite flying under the radar. Both are sorely missed co-op genres today.

### The Power of the Controller
The SNES controller expanded on the NES with additional face and shoulder buttons that enabled greater complexity. While some games used them simply, others developed new nuanced mechanics around them. Fighting games especially came into their own, facilitating intricate special moves sequences. 
Despite extra inputs, the ergonomic layout made even action-heavy fare feel natural. Its compact size rested comfortably in young and adult hands alike through marathon sessions. The iconic purple and gray color scheme also entered gaming lexicon. For many, it remains the defining joystick of the 16-bit era.
### The Social Experience  
Gathering locally to unveil and share in new releases was integral to the SNES experience. With no online or even early internet, in-person couch co-op and versus remained core ways to bond over games. Memorial moments were made conquering levels or bosses cooperatively side by side. 
Gaming parties spread word-of-mouth for anticipated titles before online communities. Crowding around newest arcade or store kiosks to sample demos built buzz. These social rituals helped reinforce gaming as a communal experience rather than solitary one it has evolved into today.
### Retaining Replay Value
Many SNES classics rewarded replays through hidden items, endings, or subtle systemic changes between runs. EarthBound is full of winkingly cryptic messages and tweaks between loops. Meanwhile, Metroid gave new sequence breaking options to sequence-oriented runs. 
Games also aged surprisingly well alone thanks to tight responsive design. Their timeless 16-bit visuals and soundtracks also lent themselves well to nostalgia. Revisiting favorites decades later still feels as magical as first experiences for many due to strong foundational designs.

Nintendo franchises cemented their legacies on the SNES by innovating their genres technically. The Super Mario World engine advanced console platforming substantially. Meanwhile, Link to the Past took the Zelda formula open world and sent it to new heights. These groundbreakers solidified loyal fanbases that still thrive today. 
Spin-offs like Mario Kart also succeeded by expanding flagship IPs into new sub-genres. Its novelty, pick-up-and-play accessibility, and multiplayer focus granted it enduring popularity that persists in subsequent installments. Both main series and experimental adjuncts paid dividends for their developers.
### Pushing Boundaries Quietly
Late in the SNES lifespan, some underseen titles still manage to innovate in their niches. Lesser known games like UN Squadron took air combat genre and gave it a unique anime style years before many similar games emerged. Meanwhile, Actraiser bravely merged sim and action elements together seamlessly. Experimentation kept the library feeling fresh throughout.
### Fun Without Pressure  
Compared to modern gaming culture's widespread critique, the SNES era had a more relaxed approach focused on entertainment over technical analysis. Without review aggregators or online echo chambers, individual discovery drove reception more than groupthink. Imperfections were overlooked due to visceral enjoyment rather than deconstructed ad nauseum. Games simply aimed to provide joyful diversions rather than be dissected.
### Everlasting Legacy  
Decades later, pixel-perfect emulation or HD remasters have kept SNES library thriving inter-generationally. Its most iconic titles remain massively influential. Beyond technical feats, the SNES era captured gaming's spirit of fun many feel has since been lost. It balanced challenge and variety amid empowering creativity that later eras have struggled to match at times. For that reason, it maintains a hallowed place in retrospective.
### The Social Experience: Gathering Friends to Play
Couch co-op multiplayer action games and RPGs were a blast to enjoy with friends locally back in the SNES era. Games like the Super Mario World series were a total blast to cooperatively play through with a buddy on the same console, coordinating jumps and actions to reach the goal. Meanwhile RPGs like Final Fantasy helped foster bonding experiences leveling up characters and solving dungeons together. These socially-driven multiplayer elements were core to the SNES experience before online gaming took off. Gathering folks over was highly encouraged just for the communal fun of tackling games side by side on the same TV. Certain boss battles in particular made for edge-of-your-seat shared victories. Local co-op kept friends engaged for hours in a way solitary gaming has struggled to match.

Many masterful SNES titles rewarded replaying with new secrets, tweaks or strategies between runs. The Earthbound series in particular was wonderful for this, featuring cryptic lore and Easter eggs easily missed on a first playthrough.
