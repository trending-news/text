## Basic Security Tips for PSVR 
### Always Keep Your System Up to Date
Sony regularly releases software updates for the PlayStation VR to address security issues and bugs. Making sure your system is running the latest version is critical to maintaining a secure environment. Check for updates automatically or manually at least once a month.

### Enable Two-Factor Authentication 
Adding an extra layer of protection on your PlayStation Network account helps prevent unauthorized access in the event your password is compromised. Consider enabling two-factor authentication through the Sony website to require a unique code when logging in from unknown devices.
### Be Cautious of Strangers Online
As with any online platform, exercise care when interacting with others. Do not accept friend requests or messages from people you do not know personally. Their intentions may not always be friendly. Maintain privacy settings to limit who can contact you.
## Securing Your PlayStation Network Account
### Require Regular Password Changes
Forcing password expiration, like every 90 days, ensures your credentials stay up to date even if compromised. Outdated passwords pose unnecessary risk if the same ones are used long-term. 
### Review Login History
Take a few minutes periodically to examine sign-in locations listed in your account security settings. Unfamiliar entries could indicate unauthorized access attempts from another country. Change your password immediately if suspicious activity is spotted.
### Enable Parental Controls If Sharing 
If allowing family to use the same PlayStation account, consider enabling purchase restrictions and screen time limits. This prevents unwanted expenses and helps regulate appropriate usage.
## Protecting Your Router and Home Network 
### Secure Your Wireless Network
Use a strong, randomized WiFi password and enable the latest WPA2 encryption standard. Avoid common or simple passwords easily guessed by hacker tools. Consider segregating IoT devices onto a separate isolated network as an added level of protection.  
### Stay Up to Date With Firmware 
Like any Internet-connected device, routers require ongoing maintenance. Manufacturer websites house the latest firmware versions containing critical fixes. Schedule regular automatic checks and install any available updates promptly for optimal security hygiene.
### Tighten Administrator Access
The router control panel presents a prime target for attackers. Safeguard this sensitive interface with a unique username and complex password kept separate from common credentials. Limit login attempts if possible to curb brute force guessing.
## PlayStation VR Equipment Security
### Safely Power Down After Use
Instead of rest mode which maintains a persistent online connection, fully power off the PlayStation 4 when finished with VR. This disconnects the system from potential remote exploits until next use. 
### Cover Camera Lenses 
Slide covers included with many headsets when in storage and not playing helps dissuade hypothetical snoopers through any theoretical vulnerabilities. An extra privacy safeguard causes no harm. 
### Consider Disabling Online Access  
After gaming sessions, consider temporarily disabling online connectivity for an added layer of isolation until next use. While not practical for all users, it reduces theoretical surface area for potential remote compromise when not actively playing online games or content.
## Beware of Phishing Scams and Malware
### Vet All Links and Attachments 
Even from recognized contacts, always carefully inspect email content and file extensions before interaction. Phishing engineers now craft highly targeted malicious messages designed to bypass suspicion. If uncertain of legitimacy, it's usually better to disregard and contact the sender through other verified means. 
### Use Caution When Browsing
While surfing the internet, practice vigilance against sketchy websites requesting sensitive login info or prompting file downloads. Verify any official communications by contacting support directly instead of blindly following web links. Apply similar precautions across all internet-connected devices in the home network.
### Keep Antivirus Software Updated  
Free or paid antivirus utilities help safeguard computers and mobile devices that interface with PlayStation consoles. Remember to keep virus definitions and engine components refreshed for round-the-clock malware protection across all internet points of entry into the home.
## Securing Connected Devices and Web Browsing
### Change Default Credentials 
When setting up IoT accessories that pair with VR headsets, like motion controllers, be sure to alter preconfigured usernames and passwords. Factory defaults represent a huge security oversight inviting exploitation. Regularly review all linked products for firmware patches as well. 
### Closely Monitor Authorized Devices
Take inventory of every gadget with network access. Remove permissions for any no longer in active use to reduce unnecessary exposed surface area. Monitor what can ‘see and be seen’ for optimum security administrative hygiene. 
### Use Encrypted Networks Cautiously  
Public hotspots present risks so limit sensitive operations and avoid logging into accounts, games or making purchases while connected to open access points. Apply discretion depending on data being transmitted and websites being browsed.
## Physical PS VR Security and Device Monitoring
### Secure Equipment Out of Sight
Invest in wall-mounted security fixtures or locking safes to deter would-be thieves from making off with expensive VR gear left unattended. Consider engraving unique identifying information as a theft deterrent and for potential recovery.
### Setup Security Cameras 
A baby monitor or IP camera watching the play space allows peace of mind while immersed in virtual worlds. Caught-in-the-act footage acts as a strong deterrent against potential malefactors scoping out swipe-able electronics left temporarily unsupervised. 
### Use Caution with Young Children
While VR provides fun edutainment, ensure safe developmental guidelines are followed. Remain physically present supervising interactions for children too young to identify potential hazards independent of guardians. Maintain awareness of psychological impact intensive gaming may incur.
## Special Concerns for Public Wi-Fi Usage
### Employ VPNs for Anonymized Browsing
Open networks allow snooping of traffic unencrypted. A Virtual Private Network obscures online activity and helps thwart man-in-the-middle data hijacking by concealing traffic within an encrypted tunnel. Consider a paid subscription from a trustworthy provider.
### Avoid Sensitive Actions on Public Wi-Fi  
Resist temptation to login, load private files or make financial transactions when reliant on unsecured access points. Hotspots afford complete view into communications absent encryption or VPN. Wait until returning home or use mobile data as an alternative.
### Disable Auto-Connecting to Networks
Turn off the console setting joining any available network automatically. Manually pick connections case-by-case to sidestep phony impostor hotspots laid as hacker traps. Unknown entities deserve extra suspicion and scrutiny before association.  
## Staying Safe in Virtual Reality
### Take Frequent Breaks from Extended Play
Sustained VR use strains eyes and risks nausea or disorientation. Developers incorporate rest reminders every 30-60 minutes depending on content. Listen to on-screen prompts and don't ignore body warnings from overexertion. Shorter frequent sessions prove healthier than marathon sessions.
### Clear Playspace and Good Lighting
VR fully immerses players yet cables and physical factors remain. Keep floors clear of clutter and trip hazards that could impact enjoyment or safety. Ambient lighting helps prevent accidents by maintaining awareness of surroundings while playing. 
### Use Common Sense Precautions
Avoid VR during storms, high winds or other distracting environmental scenarios increasing accident potential. Similarly, don't play if under the influence of substances hindering clear thinking and quick reflexes. Common sense strategies prove most prudent.
