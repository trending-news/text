Growing up in military base schools during the 1960s-1970s meant a strict disciplinary environment where corporal punishment was commonplace and failure could lead to one's parents being called in. However, these schools also emphasized high educational standards and many students became fluent in multiple languages. Physical altercations were frequent as students were encouraged to develop survival and fighting skills for the realities of war.
### Witnessing the Horrors of Combat  
War brings out the worst in humanity. As a soldier in Vietnam, witnessing entire villages destroyed by the Viet Cong and seeing innocent women and children brutally murdered left deep scars. One's first experience of death in combat is something that stays with a person for life. The ongoing health impacts from Agent Orange exposure are also a reminder of the human costs of war that last for decades.

### Covert Operations in a Secret War   
Laos played a covert but pivotal role in the Vietnam War. A radar installation provided vital intelligence for American bombing raids. When its location was discovered, the facility and some soldiers fell in a battle now known as Lima Site 85. The veteran's father served there and was deeply troubled by the events, underscoring how even secret wars take their toll.
### Training for War
Seeking to serve his country and gain experience, the veteran enrolled in ROTC at Texas A&M University. He enlisted earlier than planned due to a belief the war would end soon. Completing rigorous Airborne and Special Forces training, he went on to lead a platoon of Cambodian soldiers, taking on roles of greater responsibility.
### The Post-War Struggle
For many veterans, the war was far from over after their return home. Untreated depression and PTSD took a steep toll on their physical and mental health in the post-war years. Many felt the human and financial costs of the Vietnam War far outweighed the limited strategic gains. Deception and dishonesty in the government's policy damaged trust in the country's leadership. The wasted lives and resources would shape veterans' perspectives for decades.
### The Other Side's Story  
Textbooks in Vietnam portrayed the US in a very different light - as new colonizers attempting to suppress national liberation. The South Vietnamese government was depicted as a "puppet regime" dependent on American control and aid. Accounts also emphasized downplaying North Vietnamese and Viet Cong casualties while exposing alleged US war crimes. It is vital to understand how the legacy of the war is remembered differently on each side.
### Life on High Alert in Firebases
Hilltop firebases were well-defended but highly vulnerable outposts. Constant mortar and rocket attacks kept soldiers in a state of high alert. Artillery provided support via coordinated barrages to defend the bases under fire. The noise and danger of sustained combat created an ever-present stress that deepened over time in these primitive frontal positions.
### Censorship and the Burden of Memory
To avoid potential issues with the Vietnamese government decades later, anonymity is important for some veterans sharing their experiences. Even 50 years on, unfair public blame still weighs heavily on those who served. While censoring some details, this veteran hopes opening up about their service provides insight into the human costs of war that often go undisclosed.
