## Introduction
The question of whether downloaded Nintendo Switch games require an online connection to play is a common one. This article will explore the general rules around offline play, as well as some important exceptions and additional considerations. 
### Downloads and Local Storage 
Downloading games to the Nintendo Switch console eliminates the need for physical game cards or cartridges. But can you play those downloaded games without an internet connection once they've been installed? Let's dive into the details.

## General Rule - Yes, Downloaded Games Can Be Played Offline
If a game has been fully downloaded and installed on the Nintendo Switch console, either to its internal storage or an inserted microSD card, it does not need a live internet connection to play once loaded. All game data and save files are stored locally on the Switch itself. This means most downloaded games provide the convenience of digital downloads with the flexibility of also being playable offline whenever one likes.
## Exceptions for Certain Online-Focused Games  
While the majority of titles support offline single-player experiences, there are some exceptions focused more around networked or multiplayer online gameplay. For example, games in the Splatoon series have minimal single-player or co-op options compared to their substantial online multiplayer modes. The same applies to games centered around online battles and competitions, such as Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, which requires a connection to access Live features like Smash online play.
### Online-Centric Design
Games primarily or solely designed for persistent online play simply have less meaningful offline components by their very nature. Their core mechanics, progression systems and primary modes of engagement are typically tied directly into online player networks and servers. Without a connection, all one could access locally would be limited tutorial or demo-like experiences.
## Account and Profile Restrictions
Nintendo Switch digital game licenses are tied to individual user accounts on the Nintendo network. Downloads are only valid for the specific Nintendo Account that purchased them from the Nintendo eShop. They can only be played using that Account on the singular primary console registered to that Account. Other profiles on the same Switch can play games from their own saves, assuming the purchasing Account remains active on that device. However, simultaneous multiplayer across multiple profiles is restricted per Account and Switch pairing.
### User Profiles and Saves 
Beyond the initial install, further restrictions exist around how many profiles can access valid save data from a single purchased digital title. Typically, only one 'linked' profile per game download provides full access to things like bonus content and online connectivity features from that Account. Additional profiles on the same Switch console are limited just to standalone gameplay and independent save data for that profile only.
## Storage Requirements and Internet Dependencies
Installing digital games on a Switch requires sufficient free storage space, either internally or on a microSD memory card. The full download size of each title must be accommodated prior to play. And while offline gameplay is supported post-download, an internet connection is still compulsory for the initial purchase and installation process from the eShop online storefront. 
### System Updates 
Ongoing online connectivity is also important for accessing future gameplay updates and patches released by Nintendo and third-party developers. These help optimize game performance, resolve bugs and introduce new features over time which install automatically when a Switch next connects online. Without internet access, systems eventually risk missing out on potential improvements and fixes.
### Managing Storage Space
Proper storage management and periodic clearing of unused or finished software titles remains important for Switch users hoping to leverage both digital downloads and offline play flexibility long-term. Games with hefty install sizes or large libraries risk clogging available space without proactive maintenance of what's stored locally on their system. An unstable or limited home internet connection further complicates such management tasks requiring online title re-downloads.
## Subscription Services May Apply
While the core gameplay of most downloaded Switch titles can be enjoyed offline, some subscription-based services and expansions require an online connection to authenticate and access special content or features. For example, many of the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack's retro libraries of old Nintendo 64 and SEGA Genesis games demand an active paid subscription. And the basic Switch Online membership itself is still compulsory for playing certain games' online multiplayer modes when using downloadable versions instead of physical cartridges.
### Authenticating Subscriptions
These network-based subscriptions and expansions rely on checking the Nintendo account's subscription status whenever the associated software is opened on a Switch. So an internet connection becomes necessary at certain points like initial launch, even if only to verify the active subscription, before then allowing fully offline play of included games and content. Lack of connection prevents utilizing subscription perks until eligibility can be confirmed online again.
## Re-downloading Purchased Games
An advantage of downloading games digitally with a Nintendo Account is the ability to re-download titles as needed. If data becomes corrupted or needs to be transferred to a new system, those previous digital purchases allow easy restores versus losing access with physical media that may become damaged over time. Game files can simply be downloaded again from the Nintendo eShop app after logging into ones account.
### Access Indefinitely
The Nintendo eShop acts as a permanent digital game library for re-downloading titles at any time, provided the linked account remains active. Any game bought from the online store remains linked indefinitely based on having purchased it at least once before with that account. There is no expiration timer on this restore ability either, allowing Switch owners to build up sizable digital libraries over the console's lifespan and beyond even to future devices potentially.
## Conclusions
In summary, yes the Nintendo Switch does enable offline gameplay of downloaded digital titles in most cases, without requiring an internet connection once installed. The core gaming experiences of standard eShop releases are designed to be fully playable this way for maximum flexibility. However, exceptions exist for network-centric games and certain subscription features that still demand authentication checks periodically. Proper storage management also factors into sustained offline access long-term when digital is the chosen purchase preference over physical cartridges which free up storage. Overall, the Switch provides a healthy balance between the versatility of downloads and offline mobility depending on one's needs.
