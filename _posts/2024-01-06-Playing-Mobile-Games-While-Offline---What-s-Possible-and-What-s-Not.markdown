### Real Racing 3  
Real Racing 3 is a racing simulation mobile game developed by Electronic Arts. While much of the game requires an internet connection, there are some limited offline capabilities. For example, the game sometimes fails to save progress for daily login bonuses when played without wifi. However, there is a hack that allows changing the date on your device to trigger any missed bonuses without being connected to the internet. While not the intended gameplay, this allows unlocking some additional features offline.

### Bombsquad 
Bombsquad is a multiplayer party game developed by Steel Crate Games. Unlike many mobile games, Bombsquad supports local offline multiplayer through wireless hotspot or LAN connections. This allows groups of players to get together without an internet connection by connecting their phones to each other. One phone acts as the "host" and shares its local IP address. Others can then join the private match by entering this address. This provides the unique ability to enjoy multiplayer Bombsquad games anywhere, even without wifi access.
### League of Legends 
League of Legends is one of the most popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games worldwide, developed and published by Riot Games. As a MOBA, League of Legends requires constant online connectivity between players during matches. Without an active internet connection, the game will not load or function at all. This is due to the networked gameplay mechanics that connect all participants in real-time. Playing League of Legends in an offline mode is simply not possible due to this inherent online multiplayer design.
### Modern Combat 5 
Modern Combat 5: Blackout is a first-person shooter game developed by Gameloft. While the game does feature single player campaign modes that can be played offline after initial download, there are some limitations. Accessing progression features like new levels or weapons often requires a data connection to sync with game servers. Individual missions within a campaign may be playable offline, but the game is not truly fully functioning without an internet connection to the backend services.
### Elden Ring 
Elden Ring is an action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. Like previous FromSoftware titles, Elden Ring gives players the option to play solo in an offline mode disconnected from online services. While this prevents interacting with messages, bloodstains or encountering other players in the open world, it allows fully experiencing the core single player campaign and storyline without wifi access. The massive open world and difficult boss encounters can be conquered offline for those seeking an uninterrupted Elden Ring experience away from internet connections.
### Love Nikki 
Love Nikki is a fashion simulation mobile game developed by Elex Technology. As a social dress up game, Love Nikki allows some limited previously accessed offline functionality without an internet connection. For example, players can view clothing and avatar options they have already unlocked while offline. However, most core online features like participating in live events, interacting with other players, or accessing the full store require an active data connection. While small portions of previously viewed content are accessible offline, Love Nikki emphasizes online social gameplay mechanics that cannot be fully experienced without wifi access.
### Wolcen vs Diablo 3 
Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem is an action role-playing game developed by Wolcen Studio while Diablo 3 was created by Blizzard Entertainment. Unlike Diablo 3 which requires a constant online connection even for solo play, Wolcen allows true offline functionality. The campaign and co-op modes can be played both online and offline. Local area network (LAN) support also permits linking phones/PCs together wirelessly for offline co-op play anywhere. An internet connection is not mandatory in Wolcen, though it does enhance the experience with online features. Some have also reported fewer technical bugs and disconnects when playing Wolcen in its fully offline state compared to Diablo 3's always-online design.
### Conclusion 
In summary, different types of mobile games have varying capabilities and limitations when it comes to offline play depending on their core design focus. Games like Real Racing 3, Love Nikki and Modern Combat 5 allow limited previously unlocked single player content access offline but require internet for full functionality. Multiplayer focused MOBAs and live service games will simply not function at all without online connectivity. However, some titles such as Bombsquad, Elden Ring, and Wolcen provide true offline support through local network play or entirely solo offline campaigns, allowing mobile gaming away from wifi access. Overall, considering a game's online requirements and prioritizing offline compatible genres can help maximize mobile gaming enjoyment on the go without internet connectivity whenever possible.
