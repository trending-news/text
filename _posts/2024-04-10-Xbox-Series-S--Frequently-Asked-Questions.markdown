The Xbox Series S is Microsoft's entry-level next-gen console offering performance upgrades over the Xbox One at an affordable price. But many have questions about certain capabilities and features it offers. This post aims to answer some of the most common frequently asked questions surrounding the digital-only Series S.
## Can Xbox One Games and Discs Work on Xbox Series S?
While the Series S is fully backwards compatible with the vast majority of the Xbox One library, it is a digital-only console without a disc drive. Any physical Xbox One games you own on disc will need to be purchased again digitally through the Xbox Store to play on Series S. Unfortunately, inserting an Xbox One disc won't allow you to install and play the game from that disc. The Series S was designed as an all-digital experience focused on downloading games rather than using discs.
## How Physical Xbox 360 Games Can Be Played  
When an Xbox 360 game disc is inserted into the Series S, it will download a full digital version of the game which includes a proprietary emulator allowing it to run on the more powerful new hardware. This "virtual emulator" makes the game think it's running on an Xbox 360 internally while outputting at higher resolutions. The physical disc is only required for verification of ownership the first time and isn't needed afterwards. The entire game runs directly off the internal storage rather than from the disc once installed.
## Key Hardware Upgrades and New Features
Under the hood, the Series S packs a custom AMD Zen 2 CPU and RDNA 2 graphics capable of outputting gameplay at 1440p resolution and up to 120 frames per second. Compared to the original Xbox One, this provides substantially faster loading times thanks to the SSD storage and increased processing power allows for higher fidelity visuals including support for HDR and some ray tracing effects. It also sips power at just 100 watts while gaming compared to the 150 watts of the original Xbox One. With its small 11.8 x 6.5 x 2.5 inch compact design, it's perfect for smaller spaces and can even stand upright.
### Is the Upgrade from an Xbox One Worth It?
For existing Xbox One owners still satisfied with their current console's performance, the Series S alone may not seem like a worthy upgrade unless you want access to the newest generation of gaming features and technology. But those still using the very first and largest Xbox One model from 2013 will see much more significant benefits from the Series S in terms of visuals, loading speeds, and the newer Xbox interface. If you want to experience modern gaming at its best currently, the Series S provides that without breaking the bank.

### How Console Game Sharing Works
One of the benefits of Xbox's modular ecosystem is the ability to share your digital games between multiple systems. By designating one console as your "home Xbox", any other profile signed into that console will have access to play any games purchased under your account. Simultaneously, you can play those same games on a separate non-home Xbox by signing in with your profile that purchased them. This allows for household sharing of games between multiple TVs without purchasing multiple copies.
## Why Periodic Online Connection is Required  
While the Series S is capable of playing many games offline without an internet connection, there are some restrictions. Microsoft requires periodic checks online to verify your ownership rights for things like digital licenses and to allow security/compatibility updates to be installed automatically in the background. For those without any internet access at all, this can unfortunately cause issues playing purchased games when an online connection can't be established for validation. However, these online checks are infrequent and typically only take a few minutes.
### External Storage Expansion with USB Drives
Thanks to its 512GB of internal SSD storage, the Series S has ample space right out of the box for installing dozens of games. But for those who want even more, almost any standard external USB 3.0 or faster hard drive can be plugged directly into the console to expand available storage by up to 1TB. This external drive can be used for storing and playing and next-gen optimized titles that don't require taking full advantage of the internal SSD speed. So in total up to 1.5TB of storage is achievable between internal and external drives with the Series S.
## Benefits of Upgrading from Xbox 360
Jumping from the last generation Xbox 360 to the Series S provides night and day improvements. Load times for games are drastically reduced, visuals see immense enhancements with higher native resolutions and detailed textures, and the compact all-in-one design is lighter and more convenient. Backward compatibility allows continuing to play thousands of classic 360 games while also gaining access to the massive and growing catalog of next-gen optimized titles. Controls are improved, online functionality expanded, and with Game Pass subscribers have instant access to over 100 high-quality games starting at $10/month. It's an extremely worthwhile upgrade over the aging Xbox 360 hardware.
### Is the Series S a Good Value for New/Lapsed Gamers? 
At $299, the Series S strikes an attractive balance of affordability and next-generation capabilities. It becomes an appealing entry point or return to modern gaming without spending $500 or more. The combination of Game Pass and a massive libraries of backward compatible games provides continual value as a platform. For casual or less frequent gamers, its performance packed into a small design at a low price point makes the Xbox Series S a fantastic value oriented option to experience current and future titles for many years to come.
