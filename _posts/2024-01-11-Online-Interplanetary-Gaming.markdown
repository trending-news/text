## Introduction  
Gaming has become a hugely popular form of entertainment on Earth, with billions of people regularly playing video games. As space exploration ramps up and humanity looks to establish a permanent presence on the Moon and Mars, the idea of space colonists gaming with each other across the solar system is an exciting prospect. With ongoing improvements to space communication technologies, real-time multiplayer games between Earth and Mars may soon become a reality. This article explores some of the possibilities for online interplanetary gaming and the technical challenges that need to be overcome to make this vision a reality.
## Possible games between Earth and Mars
Some turn-based games like chess or correspondence games would be well suited to the interplanetary lag times inherent in light-speed communication delays. Players on Earth and Mars could take turns making moves in their spare time, with updates transmitted at regular intervals via spacecraft. Real-time strategy games scaled down to manageable levels could also possibly work across the distances involved. Careful game and infrastructure design will be crucial to enabling enjoyable interplanetary multiplayer experiences within the constraints of light-speed lag.
### Turn-based games across lightyears
Games like chess that do not require real-time interaction would be well suited to play between planets. Players could take turns making moves during their off-hours, with updates bundled onto regularly scheduled deep space network transmissions. Online variants of classics like Go, Risk, and Civilization could also work well in a turn-based interplanetary context. Infrastructure to support asynchronous messaging of game states would need to be established but could help combat loneliness for early space colonists.

## Turn-based games across lightyears 
### Real-time strategy games scaled down
Some real-time strategy (RTS) games could potentially work across the astronomically high latencies between Earth and Mars if properly designed. Games would need to involve much smaller maps and fewer units than typical contemporary RTS titles. Simpler gameplay focused more on resource gathering and base/city building rather than massive armies may allow enjoyable real-time interaction despite lag times in the tens of minutes. Reduced scope would help compensate for sluggish responsiveness inherent over interplanetary distances. Periodic asynchronous save states could also assist with latency hassles. With the right scaling down and adaptation of mechanics, some RTS franchises may find audiences among lunar and planetary colonists.
## Reducing lag through entanglement
One experimentally proven method for eliminating lag in communication is by exploiting quantum entanglement. Because entangled particles can transmit information instantly regardless of physical separation, they provide a way to circumvent the light-speed delay that plagues traditional radio-based communication in space. While tremendously challenging, establishing an interplanetary quantum communication network using entangled photons or atoms could potentially enable real-time multiplayer games between players on Earth and Mars. Significant research is still needed to scale quantum technologies to work over interplanetary distances in a practical and affordable way. But if realized, entanglement could transform online gaming possibilities throughout the solar system.

### Massively multiplayer online games
Even with today's substantial communication lags, some multiplayer online games could work across planetary distances if scaled up in scope and adapted for slower responsiveness. Massively multiplayer online (MMO) games center around vibrant virtual worlds full of player-controlled avatars interacting in real time. By expanding map sizes, lowering population densities, and focusing more on individual questing than massive realm-vs-realm conflicts, it may be possible to create MMOs enjoyable by gamers separated by light-minutes. Periodic asynchronous saving of game states could also help players cope with latency issues inherent to interplanetary play. With smart design considerations for lag, some MMO franchises could find new audiences among pioneers living on the Moon and Mars.

### Setting up gaming communities in space
For online interplanetary gaming to really take off, dedicated gaming communities will need to emerge among the early space colonists living on the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Pioneering these off-Earth outposts provides an ideal environment for tightly knit gaming collectives to form. Local area networks could allow for enjoyable multiplayer gameplay within lunar or Martian settlements. And organized regional gaming groups may help combat loneliness and boredom among the first space colonists. With the availability of reliable recreation, the motivation to live and work in permanent extraterrestrial settlements could grow tremendously. Fostering strong gaming communities in space could do wonders both for personnel retention on pioneering outposts and enabling new multiplayer experiences across the inner solar system.
## Overcoming technical challenges 
While gaming across interplanetary distances presents exciting long-term possibilities, significant technical roadblocks must still be addressed to bring online interplanetary multiplayer to reality. Chief among the issues are:
- Light-speed communication latency - Roundtrip signaling times between Earth and Mars range from 8 minutes at closest approach to over 40 minutes at wider separations, posing major problems for responsive real-time play. 
- Bandwidth limitations - Traditional radio-based deep space networking provides only a trickle of bandwidth, insufficient for streaming high-fidelity graphics and audio. More robust optical communication systems will be required.
- Network reliability - Unpredictable signal dropouts, transmission errors, and other network reliability concerns are much more severe over millions of miles than terrestrial internet infrastructure addresses daily. Redundancy and fault-tolerance must be built-in.
- Remote hardware resources - Early Martian and lunar outposts will have only basic computer systems compared to high-powered gaming PCs on Earth. Games and infrastructure will need to account for this asymmetry.
Overcoming these barriers will require major investments in next-generation space communication technologies, space-hardened gateways, high-throughput laser relays, and other infrastructure unknown today except in research labs. But solving such challenges may open entire new frontiers for online gaming to explore.
## Building infrastructure for the future of space gaming
To realize the full potential of online interplanetary multiplayer gaming will require establishing dedicated communications networks, hardware infrastructure and software platforms customized for the realities of playing across light-minutes or greater separations. Some components of a fully-enabled system for widespread space gaming may include:
- Robust laser relay networks between planets, moons and spacecraft able to transmit game-friendly bandwidths 
- Array of geostationary and lunar orbit communication satellites providing ubiquitous coverage
- Standardized specifications and protocols for reliable interplanetary networking
- Latency-tolerant game engines and programming interfaces
- Dedicated servers hosted on the Moon and Mars alongside player settlements
- Streamlined software distribution and update systems for isolated outposts  
- Gaming-oriented ground stations for deep space transmissions
With targeted technical R&D and thoughtful coordination, such an infrastructure could turn interplanetary online multiplayer gaming into everyday reality within this century. The potential return on such an investment in advancing space communications could be invaluable both for recreation and social cohesion as humanity expands across the inner solar system. Where there's bandwidth, there will be bits.
