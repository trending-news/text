### Wbaduk 
Wbaduk is a popular server in Korea with many professional players actively using the site. One advantage is the large number of high-level players which makes it easy to find strong opponents. However, there are some downsides for non-Korean speakers. While basic functions can be used in English, advanced features and the community aspects involve Korean. The client interface also feels outdated and lacks translation. Still, for serious players wanting high-level games, Wbaduk offers that due to its large professional player base.

### Kiseido Go Server (KGS)
KGS has been around for decades and remains one of the top choices for English speakers. The welcoming community is ideal for players just learning the game. Games can be played with various time controls from real-time blitz to days-long correspondence style. While the client lacks modern features, it gets the job done and remains very stable over long periods of use. Numerous learning aids like review functions and the ability to watch live commentated pro games helps improving players. With the largest Western user base, you are almost guaranteed to find opponents of your level at any time of day on KGS.
### Tygem Go Server (Tygem) 
Tygem stands out from other servers thanks to its integrated betting system where players can wager points or cash on the outcome of their games. This has attracted many strong 6-dan level players and above giving games a higher than average difficulty. While the client interface and community discussions are mostly in Korean, basic functions can be used comfortably in English. Having this level of competition makes Tygem excellent for serious players wanting to test their skills in pressure games. The betting also creates extra incentive during close fought battles.
### Internet Go Server (Pandanet IGS)
As one of the earliest online go servers still in operation, Pandanet IGS has a long history and tradition. It remains very popular in parts of Asia and Europe. A notable feature compared to other servers is the thriving correspondence game culture. Players can start a game and make moves over days or weeks at their convenience. IGS also supports third party software clients allowing players to access their account from any device smoothly. While the interface shows its age, under the hood it runs very reliably. 
### Online Go Server (OGS)  
In recent years, OGS has emerged as one of the top choices for Western players attracted by its modern web-based design. This means you can simply login from any computer with just a web browser - no need to download separate software. The developers actively work to implement community suggested features and improvements at a fast pace. While a younger platform than the others, its user base is growing quickly, especially in Europe and the Americas. OGS also allows players to study famous professional game records directly in the browser interface easily.
### 9x9 and 13x13 Board Games
All major go servers support alternative smaller board sizes which are excellent for beginners. The 9x9 and 13x13 boards allow games to be finished more quickly, making them suitable for reviewing positions or experimenting with new opening moves. This lets newcomers develop fundamental practical skills and tactics before graduating to the standard 19x19 size. Smaller boards can even be enjoyable for higher level players to change up the pace occasionally. Their use is commonly recommended for newcomers to go as they remove some initial complexity.  
### Additional Learning Resources
Of course, online play is just one avenue for go study. Physical books, video tutorials and software tools deepen understanding. Finding a local go club opens opportunities to meet other players face-to-face for discussing games. Setting concrete study goals, like finishing basic life and death problems, helps structure independent learning. Participating in tournaments tests skills in a competitive environment. Overall, a rounded approach integrating different study methods yields the greatest long-term improvement at the game. Online servers provide the foundation, but a diversity of supplementary resources elevates players to higher levels.
