## Introduction
Retro gaming has seen a huge surge in popularity in recent years. Many people are looking for affordable ways to enjoy their favorite classic titles from systems like Nintendo, Sega, Sony and more. This post will discuss several options for retro gaming on a cheap budget, including emulation on PCs and dedicated devices like the Raspberry Pi, modifying original consoles to add more games, and even building your own portable emulation machine.
### Emulation Fundamentals  
Emulators allow you to run classic game software, known as ROMs, on modern computers and devices. They replicate the functionality of old game consoles in software. For PC emulation, you'll need an emulator program as well as ROM files for the games you want to play. Popular emulators include ZSNES for SNES games, SNES9X, Project64 for N64, and PCSX-ReARMed for PlayStation 1. You'll also want a game controller like an Xbox 360 pad for the best experience. The Raspberry Pi is a credit card-sized computer that can run many retro emulators with low-powered hardware.

### Retro Gaming with a PC 
With just about any modern Windows or Mac computer, you can set up retro gaming through emulation. Download emulator programs like ZSNES, SNES9X, Project64, MAME, and others depending on the systems you want to play. Pair the emulators with ROM files and use an Xbox 360 or similar gamepad for controls. This is a cost-effective way to start a retro collection without buying original hardware. With higher-end PCs, you can even emulate more powerful 3D consoles like Nintendo 64, PlayStation, and Dreamcast. 
### Raspberry Pi Retro Gaming
The Raspberry Pi is perfect for budget-friendly retro emulation. Models like the Pi 3 and Pi 4 can run emulators for 8-bit and 16-bit 2D systems flawlessly. You can assemble a case, add storage, pick emulator software, pair a gamepad, and enjoy on your TV. Later Pi models can even emulate some 3D systems decently. With an official Pi screen like the PiTFT, you can build your own portable console. The Pi opens many options from simple emulation to projects like building a dedicated handheld.
### Modifying Original Consoles
While emulation has advantages, original hardware retains nostalgic charm. You can extend the life of classic systems through modification. For example, adding an SD card loaded with hundreds of games essentially turns a Nintendo SNES or NES Classic Edition into an all-in-one retro console. The inexpensive Classic2Magic mod kit makes this simple. You can also transform an original Xbox into an entertainment center with Kodi and emulators added through its powerful onboard hardware. Mods breathe new life into nostalgic pieces without spending a fortune on tracking down individual cartridges.
### Building a Custom Handheld
For the more ambitious DIY types, building your own portable emulator device is hugely satisfying. You can use a Raspberry Pi, screen, 3D printed case, and battery pack to construct a handheld gaming PC no larger than a game boy. The Super Pi Boy project shows how to assemble one which fits in a jacket pocket. By 3D printing button overlays and mounting appropriate gamepads, it plays retro favorites on the go without draining a phone battery. Portable emulation extends retro fun beyond the home and lets you show off your hard work.
### Controls and ROM Sourcing
When choosing an emulator platform, consider how you plan to control games. Retro consoles primarily used handheld controllers or specific button/joystick setups. Pis and computers support many USB pads. But for authenticity, you may wire physical buttons directly to a Pi's GPIO pins using simple circuits. Legally obtaining ROM files can be tricky since downloading without owning the original game is piracy. But if you have the game cartridge or disc, then backups for personal use are argued as legitimate under "personal archiving." Protect yourself by only using ROMs of games already in your physical collection.
### Higher-End Options
While budget options like Pis can handle 2D and some 3D retro games, more advanced single-board computers deliver even better emulation quality. The Odroid XU4 surpasses most Pis by running PlayStation 1 with enhanced graphics and nearly full compatibility. It also excels at Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn, and other polygon-based 3D systems. Dreamcast presents lag on Pi but runs smoothly on higher-specced Odroid boards. So consider upgrading as your retro gaming grows to include more complex 3D era titles.
### Staying on the Right Side of the Law
Despite controversies, emulation remains in a legal gray area when used without commercializing or gaining profit. While creating and distributing emulators themselves might raise questions, utilizing existing emulators for personal use and only downloading backed-up ROM files of owned cartridges/discs is considered lawful. Similarly, modifying original retro consoles like the NES or SNES Classic Edition for broader game options is fine. Commercial emulators gain full legality by obtaining permission from game studios. As a hobbyist, focus on having fun and avoiding distributing copyrighted game content without permission.
### Getting Started Tips
For newcomers diving into DIY retro gaming, start with the easy-to-use RetroPie software for Raspberry Pis. It bundles the basics for hassle-free setup. The NOOBs installation method also neatly packages recommendations for smooth Pi configuration. If any terms leave you scratching your head, exploring emulator names or learning more about Raspberry Pi hardware gets you up to speed. Retro gaming revival has never been more accessible thanks to thriving online communities developing cost-friendly solutions. Jump right in - there are multiple directions to go. 
### Conclusion
In summary, reliving retro classics has become easier and more affordable than ever before. Through emulation, you can enjoy favorites from Nintendo, Sega, PlayStation, and more on a computer or single-board gadget without breaking the bank. Modifying original 8-bit/16-bit consoles expands their game libraries. And ambitious builders can craft customized handheld emulation devices. Whether exploring nostalgic software or tackling new projects, retro fanatics now have many budget avenues. The options are plentiful - it's time to start gaming!
