Nintendo partnered with Philips in the early 1990s to create an add-on disc drive for the Super NES called the "SNES-CD". However, the partnership fell through leading to Philips releasing Zelda and Mario games on their failed CD-i console instead. Without the partnership, Nintendo was left without an optical disc format for the SNES. This missed opportunity prevented them from competing in the new disc-based media that came to define 3D gaming.
### Extended Reign of the Mega Drive  
With no PlayStation entering the market in 1994, the Sega Saturn saw no major competition and was in a position to succeed the Genesis/Mega Drive as the dominant console. However, Sega rushed its release in an attempt to establish an early lead over the rumored PlayStation. The lack of games and high price led to disappointing sales and an opening for other consoles to rise up instead.

### Prolonged 16-bit Era  
The extended timeframes without 32-bit consoles allowed the 8-bit and 16-bit eras to continue evolving for longer. More advanced 16-bit systems like the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, Atari Jaguar, and Amiga CD32 tried to bring optical disc technology to the existing generation. This slowed the transition to the CD-based, 3D capable hardware that defined the 32-bit generation.
### Rise of the 3DO Format  
By establishing itself early with a standard optical disc format, the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer was in prime position to succeed where other consoles faltered. Support from major third party developers and a lower retail price helped it gain momentum through the mid-1990s. Without competition from PlayStation, 3DO was able to establish itself as the leading console platform of the era. 
### Later Transitions to 32/64-bit  
Both Nintendo and Sega still launched their N64 and Saturn consoles in the second half of the 1990s. However, without the competition posed by Sony, they saw less pressure to move hardware forward at the rapid pace of the real timeline. This allowed the 16-bit era to extend longer before the transition to 32/64-bit gaming began in earnest.
### Would Sony Still Enter the Market?
Even without the success of the original PlayStation, Sony's experience in audio-visual hardware may have still driven them to enter the console industry independently. They possessed the manufacturing capabilities and desire to break into new markets that could have led them to launch their own console later in the decade through internal development rather than partnership with Nintendo.
### Continued Generation Dominance  
In the absence of an innovative new market entrant like Sony, the console industry may have remained stable with Nintendo and Sega continuing their generational dominance. New competitors like 3DO could have seen some success but likely neither would have significantly disrupted the established order between Nintendo and Sega without PlayStation's revolutionary impact. 
### Eventual Sony Market Entry  
Sony's brand, manufacturing expertise, and desire to expand into new electronics categories virtually assured they would eventually enter the console business through an internally developed system. It may have taken a few more years, but their strengths strongly suggested independent entry even without the Nintendo partnership that led to the first PlayStation.
### An Unknowable Alternate History
With so many small changes cascading over time into vastly different outcomes, truly predicting how this history may have unfolded is impossible. Both Nintendo and Sega could have succeeded or failed in new ways. The entire direction and companies leading the industry may have looked entirely different without PlayStation's key role in shaping our timeline. The future remained unwritten.
