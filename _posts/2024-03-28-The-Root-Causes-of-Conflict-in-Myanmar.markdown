## Historical Divisions
Burma, now known as Myanmar, has long been a patchwork of diverse ethnic groups and tribal alliances that historically operated independently prior to British colonization. When the British assumed control of Burma in 1885, they exploited these preexisting divisions through manipulative “divide and conquer” policies that armed some groups against others. This sowed long-term distrust between communities that persists today.
### Fragmented Identities  
Burma consists of over 100 indigenous ethnicities speaking over 100 languages. Before British rule, independent Shan, Kachin, Karen and other states governed their own territories with minimal oversight from the Ava Kingdom based in central Burma. The British centralized authority but also inflamed tensions between groups.

## Ethnic Nationalism vs. Centralized Rule
As Burma fought for independence after World War II, the dominant Bamar ethnic group pushed for a strong centralized state that would bring the entire country under majority rule. However, this marginalized minority groups seeking self-governance. The independence movement focused on a nationalist Burmese identity defined by religion and language that excluded ethnic minorities. 
### Demands for Autonomy
During negotiations over independence, ethnic armed organizations emerged demanding federalism, power sharing or autonomy for their respective states and peoples. However, the military governments that came to power after a 1962 coup forcefully imposed centralized rule from Rangoon and cracked down on dissent. This fueled armed insurgencies among minorities.
## Exploitation of Resources
Burma is rich in natural gas, gems, timber and poppy crops. However, decades of military dictatorship have meant the Tatmadaw military and associated cronies control much of the economy. Both the military government and some armed opposition groups profit from cross-border trades, resource extraction and drug industries in contested ethnic areas.
### Conflict Economies
Some analyze that certain leaders on both sides have an interest in maintaining a low-level civil war since it provides opportunities for lucrative business ventures in conflict zones. There is evidence that outbreaks of violence have sometimes coincided with periods when peace talks appeared to be making progress toward political settlements and ceasefires.
## Legacy of British Colonialism 
The British employed tactics that deliberately armed some ethnic groups to use against others when resistance emerged to their rule. During World War II, the British also supported insurgencies in non-Bamar areas as a tactic to retaliate against Burma’s cooperation with occupying Japan. The consequences of these colonial policies still linger in the form of deep communal distrust and militarization of minority states.
### Arming the Krags
For example, in the 19th century the British had the Karenni people, also known as the Karens, trained and supplied with weapons to patrol frontier areas as a buffer against rebellions. This cemented the Karen’s role as unofficial auxiliaries to British forces, earning them deep resentment from the Bamar people and setting the stage for future conflict.
## Absence of Political Representation
Since independence, Burma has been led by military dictatorships or quasi-civilian governments still dominated by the Bamar ethnic majority and military interests. Minority groups are underrepresented or excluded from national institutions and decision making processes. The centralized system concentrates power in the capital and does little to address minority grievances over autonomy, power sharing or self-governance. 
### Democratic Deficits
Even after a transition to a more open political system beginning in 2011, reforms have been limited. An entrenched military still wields tremendous authority outside of democratic control through a constitution it authored. Ethnic parties are weak and minorities largely voiceless in the national parliament. This lack of representation fuels ongoing conflicts.
## Weak Democratic Transition
Burma’s political transition beginning in 2010 was greeted with optimism but also uncertainty given the country’s unfinished reconciliation process and weak democratic foundations. As censorship and repression eased, long-simmering ethnic and religious tensions surfaced in new forms of violence. The outbreaks exposed that institutions are still developing and struggle to mediate deep-rooted communal conflicts.
### Unmet Expectations  
While historic elections in 2015 were relatively free and fair, the civilian government shares power with the military which boycotted the vote. Ethnic groups hoped for greater autonomy after decades of oppression but faced resistance. Unresolved grievances and unmet high expectations risk undermining reforms and stability. Further confidence building is needed.
## Mob Rule in Information Era  
With smartphone proliferation, Burma now has active social media spheres where information spreads rapidly. However, governing these new “public squares” remains a challenge. In a context of poor education, poverty and weakened civic trust, provocative or false news stories on Facebook and Twitter risk triggering mob actions and unrest.
### Spread of Misinformation
During outbreaks of violence against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State, for example, exaggerated and false claims on social media accusing Muslims of crimes contributed to attacks against them. The government was initially overwhelmed and did little to counter misinformation or protect vulnerable communities. This shows democratic transitions must paired with building strong fact-checking institutions and a culture of tolerance.
## Resolution will Take Time
After decades of oppression, prejudice and conflict, overcoming deep distrust between ethnicities and full national reconciliation will be an enormous long-term undertaking. Burma faces ongoing security, development and governance challenges. Building transparent democratic institutions, power sharing agreements, and a diverse yet unified national identity may take generations to achieve.
### Generational Project
Surveys find prejudices against minorities, including Muslims and Rohingyas, remain pervasive in Burmese society due to entrenched nationalist narratives. Younger generations with more open mindsets will need to gradually lead to change such attitudes. In the meantime, stopping active conflicts, upholding minority rights, justice and equitable development are critical steps toward stability and coexistence.
