## The Design of the SNES 
### Moving Away from Toys
The SNES was designed by Lance Barr to have a more sophisticated look than the NES. Barr aimed to avoid flat surfaces and angles to make the console seem less like a toy. Several initial design proposals experimented with unconventional cartridge loading mechanisms. However, the team ultimately opted for a modified vertical cartridge slot similar to the NES but with smoother curves.

### Opting for Pastels  
In an effort to appeal to both children and older gamers, the designer chose softer colors like purple and lilac rather than the bolder shades used for the SFC in Japan. These pastel hues helped make the console feel grown-up without compromising its bright, playful aesthetic. Region locking was achieved through subtle variations in cartridge shape that prevented games from other regions from being fully inserted.
## Launch Lineups and Library Size
### Quality over Quantity
While the NES launched with 17 titles, not all were well-received. In contrast, the SNES debuted with a curated selection of just 5 games that have stood the test of time as classics. Super Mario World, F-Zero, Pilotwings and others showed the potential of 16-bit hardware from the start. Though few in number, the quality of these initial releases demonstrated Nintendo's commitment to high standards.
### Comparative Price Points
The NES retailed for around $180 adjusted for inflation when it launched in 1985. Meanwhile, the SNES debuted at a slightly higher $200 in 1991, equivalent to around $400 today. However, Nintendo found ways to make subsequent consoles even more affordable over time, from the $200 N64 to the $200 GameCube. This helped broaden the player base.
## Fan Translations on the SNES
### Filling Regional Gaps
Gamers in PAL territories like Europe often had to wait months or years to access certain Super Famicom and SNES titles, if at all. This gap spawned a community of fan translators helping players experience games unavailable in their native language. Devices like the Super UFO Pro allowed playing imported cartridges from Japan and North America as well.
### Technical Comparisons
The SNES brought substantial upgrades over the NES. Stereo sound, mode 7 scaling, and advanced sprite manipulation enabled cinematic presentations and gameplay never before possible on home consoles. Optional enhancement chips on certain cartridges like Star Fox pushed the stock hardware even farther. Ports of technically complex titles like Doom also showed the potential of the aging 16-bit architecture.
## Emulator Compatibility
### Compromised Handheld Ports  
Some GBA ports of SNES classics had compromised visuals due to limitations of the portable hardware like lack of backlighting. Colors were often less vibrant while audio quality suffered. Homebrew patches were created to restore the authentic SNES experience on emulators by darkening color palettes.
## Notable SNES Games
### Setting the Standard with Chrono Trigger
Widely considered one of the greatest games ever made, Chrono Trigger blended genres seamlessly with a compelling time-traveling story. Its gameplay, art design and music composition all helped elevate the medium. Other classics like Super Mario World, Secret of Mana, and Yoshi's Island craft experiences as charming now as upon release. 
## Hong Kong 97 - A Notable Unlicensed Title
### Predicting Death through B-Movie Charm 
This unlicensed shooter took bizarre to new levels with its outrageously inaccurate plot attempting to predict the fate of a real person. Nonsensical dialogue was delivered through endless looping tracks and strange graphics. While clearly an amateur effort, its fearless weirdness has enduring cult appeal among console collectors.
## System Legacy
### Continuing Nintendo's Comeback 
Following the 1983 crash, the SNES helped cement Nintendo's return to dominance. Titles from developers given creative freedom raised the bar for adventure, platforming and more. Generations after, certain SNES games remain the pinnacle of their genres thanks to balanced, addictive and atmospheric designs cementing the system's legacy.
