## OpenAI's Mission and Founding (231 words)
### OpenAI was founded in 2015
OpenAI was founded in 2015 with the mission to promote and develop friendly artificial intelligence in a way that is beneficial to humanity. The non-profit research organization was co-founded by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and others with the goal of ensuring that as AI capabilities continue to grow, it is developed and used safely and for the benefit of all people without significant disruption. OpenAI's focus is on collaborative research to create an AI which is helpful, harmless, and honest.

## Recent Advances in Language Models (286 words)  
### OpenAI made breakthroughs with large language models
In recent years, OpenAI has made great strides in developing powerful new language models using deep learning techniques. In 2018, they released GPT, one of the first large transformer-based language models that could generate coherent paragraphs of text. Since then, they’ve introduced increasingly more capable models like GPT-2 and GPT-3 which can converse on a wide range of topics, answer questions, and generate human-like text at unprecedented scales. These language models have demonstrated how far natural language processing has advanced due to breakthroughs in deep learning and the availability of massive computational resources and datasets.
## Reduced Costs and Increased Accessibility (234 words)
### OpenAI aims to increase access to advanced AI technologies
One of OpenAI's goals is to reduce the costs associated with developing and applying advanced AI so it can benefit more organizations and citizens worldwide. To this end, they’ve published research papers, code and models to share their work and help the entire AI community progress together in a collaborative manner. They’ve also introduced new pricing and access programs to make their powerful language models more affordable and accessible to broader groups of users. By continuing to lower barriers, OpenAI hopes to spread the benefits of artificial intelligence more equitably across geographic and socioeconomic divides.
## Functionality Updates: Function Calling and Model Steerability (276 words) 
### OpenAI enhanced GPT-3 with new abilities
In 2021, OpenAI released several important updates to GPT-3 that enhanced its functionality and capabilities. They added the ability for GPT-3 to dynamically call external functions through an API, allowing its language generation to be more precisely steered and its responses augmented with data lookups or calculations from other systems. Additionally, they improved GPT-3's "steerability", or the model's ability to avoid harmful, dangerous or undesired behaviors when prompted. These updates helped ensure the model stays on task, provides helpful information to users, and can collaborate more seamlessly with other AI tools or software. The enhancements demonstrated OpenAI's ongoing efforts to continually advance their models' functionalities while prioritizing safety, reliability and benevolent objectives.
## Notable Researchers and Their Contributions (221 words)
### OpenAI research staff have pioneered new techniques
As a leader in AI research, OpenAI has assembled a talented team of researchers who have made seminal contributions to the field. Chief among them are Dario Amodei, Tom Brown, Chris Olah, Jared Kaplan, Jack Clarke and Ilya Sutskever. Dario Amodei has done groundbreaking work on beneficial AI alignment. Tom Brown co-developed BERT, one of the most influential language models. Chris Olah creates beautifully visual explanations of deep learning concepts. Jared Kaplan led research into self-supervised learning using internal prediction. Jack Clarke has provided important insights into model robustness. And Ilya Sutskever co-founded OpenAI and helped develop revolutionary sequence-to-sequence models. Their collective efforts have significantly advanced the state of AI.
## Focus on Reinforcement Learning and Solving Fundamental Problems (233 words)
### OpenAI applies deep RL to challenging domains  
OpenAI places strong emphasis on reinforcement learning (RL) as a promising approach for developing more capable artificial agents. Through RL, AI systems can learn complex behaviors and abilities by trial-and-error interaction with their environment, similar to how humans learn. OpenAI researchers have applied deep RL techniques to overcome challenges in dexterous manipulation, multi-agent coordination, one-shot imitation and more. They also focus on more fundamental AI safety problems through projects like Constitutional AI, which aims to build self-supervised models with strategically aligned objectives. By pushing the boundaries of RL and addressing core issues, OpenAI strives to build generally intelligent systems that behave helpfully as their abilities improve.
## Research on Effective Agent Communication (219 words)  
### OpenAI explored programming via natural language
Effective communication is critical for advanced AI systems to be beneficial. In recent years, OpenAI explored methods for programming agents and steering their behaviors through natural language. In one line of research, they developed a differentiable framework for communicating task instructions to neural networks using natural language. In another project, they introduced a technique called "constitutional AI" where models are trained via self-supervised constitutional learning to follow language-specified constraints. This allowed specifying complex objectives rather than just simple hardcoded rewards. Their communication-focused work aims to establish methods for keeping agents beneficially aligned as their intelligence amplifies.
## Work on One-Shot Imitation Learning (237 words)
### OpenAI made strides in rapidly learning from few examples  
The ability to rapidly learn new skills from just a single or few demonstrations is an important benchmark for general intelligent systems. In response, OpenAI has conducted research into one-shot or few-shot imitation learning using deep neural networks. In one experiment, they developed a model that could learn complex manipulation skills like block stacking or door opening after seeing only 1-3 video demonstrations, generalizing even to new object appearances and dynamics. In another project, they investigated methods for one-shot imitation of more abstract planning and reasoning tasks. By advancing one-shot imitation, OpenAI hopes to develop AI capable of learning efficiently from limited human guidance - a core capability for building beneficial systems aligned with human values and priorities.
## Future Goals and the Path to Beneficial Artificial General Intelligence (299 words)
### OpenAI aims to create safe and aligned AGI through continued research
Looking towards the future, OpenAI's long term goal remains developing safe and beneficial forms of artificial general intelligence through patient, rigorous research. While the full realization of human-level or superhuman AGI still seems poised in the decades ahead, important progress can be made today on core challenges like alignment, oversight and self-supervised learning. OpenAI plans to continue scaling their AI models to new heights while simultaneously making progress on constitutional AI, model oversight, and other technical approaches that help ensure advanced systems behave helpfully as their capabilities amplify. They also aim to keep building a diverse, multidisciplinary research community focused on solving the most pivotal technical and philosophical problems along the path to success. Through open collaboration, careful empirical work, and a laser focus on safety fundamentals, OpenAI's vision is to develop a future where powerful forms of AI are developed, regulated and applied safely to benefit all people worldwide without substantial disruption or downsides.
