### Using Steam Offline Mode
Steam offers an offline mode which allows you to play many of your games without an internet connection. To use it, first start Steam while connected to the internet and log into your account, making sure the "Remember my password" box is checked. Once logged in, you'll want to update all your games and launch any you may want to play offline later. Then go to Steam and select "Go Offline" under the menu. Most Steam features like the store, community, and downloading new content will be unavailable without an internet connection while in offline mode.

### Game Compatibility with Offline Mode
Many single player games that don't rely on anti-cheat software can run just fine offline after being fully downloaded. However, any progress made like achievements or saves won't sync to your Steam Cloud until you go back online periodically. Games that utilize third party launchers or require a constant internet connection to function won't work in offline mode at all. It's best to check compatibility for each of your titles beforehand to know what you can and can't play offline.
### Needed Updates and Syncing Progress
When using Steam offline for an extended period, be sure to occasionally reconnect to download any game updates or Steam software patches released during that time. Things like your Steam Cloud saves, unlocked achievements, and playtime stats also won't sync until going online again. Some multiplayer games may still allow local co-op play with other devices on the same network even if Steam is offline, but full online functionality won't be available. Keeping your games and software up-to-date helps ensure everything works smoothly once you reconnect to the internet.
### Internet Needed for Initial Download
While Steam's offline mode lets you play without being online, you'll always need an active internet connection the very first time you install a game from Steam. Even if a title has a physical disc, there are typically some files that must be downloaded through Steam before being able to play. Workarounds do exist like downloading on another PC and transferring over, but these methods are often complicated and don't always function properly. The safest approach is to install games when connected to avoid potential issues down the road.
### Limitations of Idling Programs  
Idling programs such as Idle Master allow earning Steam items and badges from games while your computer runs unattended. However, using such programs violates Steam's terms of service and Valve could choose to ban accounts without warning. There's always a risk participating in any activity that automates or manipulates Steam functionality against their policies. For the security of your account, it's best to avoid idling programs and earn rewards through legitimate gameplay instead.
### Online-Only Games
Some games on Steam are explicitly labeled as online-only, meaning they will not launch or function at all without an active internet connection. These tend to be titles heavily focused on online multiplayer modes where gameplay takes place on centralized servers. Even solo activities within online-only games typically require logging into these servers. If connectivity is interrupted, you simply won't be able to access or play such games through Steam's offline mode.  
### Activation Codes Require Internet
When redeeming product keys or codes for Steam, an internet connection is always necessary during the initial activation process. These codes need to connect to Steam's servers to validate and properly register the purchases and additions to your account. Any game, DLC, or item activated this way cannot be played until going back online to authenticate the code. Plan accordingly if you'll be without connectivity when looking to activate new content on Steam.
### Recommended Free Offline Games
A few great free-to-play games that provide full offline functionality on Steam include Dota 2, Warframe, The Walking Dead: Michonne, and Doki Literature Club. Indie titles also frequently allow full offline access without payments or persistent online requirements. Browsing the top free games on Steam is a good way to find quality options that don't mandate internet access thanks to their self-contained single player experiences.
