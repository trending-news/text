### Maximizing New Hardware
Developers were just starting to work with 3D technology during the 4th console generation. The N64 was Nintendo's first true 3D console and early titles like Super Mario 64 pushed the new hardware in innovative ways. However, the limited processing power and memory meant visuals appeared quite blocky and textures were low resolution. As the console generation continued, developers gained more experience programming for 3D which showed in later optimized titles having significantly improved visual quality. By the end of the generation, games managed to get close to squeezing all possible power from the aging hardware. While nostalgic, it's easy to see how early 3D games now seem quite dated compared to modern visual standards.

### Hardware Constraints of the 1990s
The SNES, Genesis, PlayStation, N64 and other 4th generation consoles had processing speeds, memory and graphics capabilities that seem minuscule by today's standards. Games needed to be very carefully optimized to fit within these tight constraints. As a result, 3D visuals were quite basic with low polygon counts, blurry or non-existent textures, choppy frame rates, and simple lighting and effects. Later in the generation as developers mastered the hardware, visuals steadily advanced but were still relatively basic. Despite limitations, many classic franchises made successful jumps to 3D during this era proving demand for the new dimension.
### Color Palette Restraints on Consoles 
Both the SNES and Genesis had hardware level color limitations due to their color lookup tables. The SNES favored a brighter, more vibrant palette with an emphasis on various shades of blue, red and green. In comparison, the Genesis palette tended towards darker, murkier tones with shades of grey and brown predominating. These pre-set color ranges influenced art style choices. The original PlayStation removed this restriction, allowing for a much more expansive and diverse range of colors across all titles. This greater freedom of expression impacted artistic visions.
### Targeting Audiences through Graphics
As competitors, Nintendo, Sega and Sony each aimed to capture different demographics. Nintendo's graphics were generally brighter and more cartoonish to appeal to family players. In contrast, Sega focused on cultivating an “edgier” image to attract older gamers with titles featuring grittier, high contrast visuals. The PlayStation also opted to target a more mature crowd, with darker aesthetic styles fitting its library ranging from Resident Evil to Gran Turismo. These strategic choices influenced artistic visions within technical limitations.
### Emulation Challenges and workarounds
Perfect emulation has always been difficult to achieve as older console hardware was fine-tuned for their specific architectures. Additional quirks and undocumented functionality may have been relied upon in some games. As a result, retro console emulators have historically struggled to reproduce games flawlessly. However, constant improvements to emulation software means even low-end modern PCs equipped with plugins can render older 3D games at higher internal resolutions with decent frame rates, satisfying curiosity and nostalgia. Workarounds like VR support and additional cheats/skins also enhance the classic experience.
### Accelerating 3D Graphics in the New Millennium  
While the early 3D Era is nostalgic, graphics then seem primitive compared to shortly afterward. As the 5th generation began, consoles greatly increased in power. The Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, GameCube and original Xbox offered much beefier 3D capabilities. Titles from this period hold up far better due to higher polygon counts, detailed textures, complex lighting/effects and refined visual styles. Developers rapidly gained competence creating next generation 3D vistas. Although charming, it's easy to see how earlier 3D seemed novel yet rough around the edges in its infancy compared to the maturation just a few short years later.
### Competition Drove Innovation
Each 4th generation console pushed the boundaries of what 3D was capable of at the time given their constraints. However, some systems like the N64 ran into issues. Its weaker hardware, limited color palette and lack of strong third party support meant some multiplatform games performed and looked better on PlayStation. The success of Nintendo's competitors proved gamers didn't require brand loyalty if given a more enticing alternative. These lessons pushed all manufacturers to continuously refine their craft and deliver the most advanced and appealing 3D experiences possible within each new generation.
### Preserving the Past through Emulation  
As retro gaming grows in popularity, emulation allows experiencing older classics that may otherwise be inaccessible. While original hardware and discs naturally degrade over time, digital roms can survive indefinitely when preserved properly. Various enhancements like increased internal rendering resolutions also improve outdated visuals for modern screens. Plugin additions provide bonuses like widescreen hacks, texture replacements and cheats to enhance enjoyment. In this way, emulation satisfies nostalgia while also helping to preserve gaming history for future generations to appreciate where the industry has come from.
### Continued Popularity of the N64  
Despite shortcomings compared to competitors, the Nintendo 64 library contains many much beloved titles that have endured extremely well such as Mario Kart 64 and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Scarcity of consoles in good condition combined with fans seeking their childhood games has driven up prices in the collector's market to high levels. On auction sites an unopened system can sell for thousands of dollars. With today's advancements in mini retro consoles, there seems potential for an Official Nintendo 64 Mini to be produced if Nintendo capitalizes on continued strong interest in the platform's iconic 3D lineup from its prime years. 
In summary, while early 3D games appeared primitive compared to modern standards, each generation built upon the last to continuously advance the fledgling 3D medium despite hardware and technical restrictions. Their imperfect visuals represent the exciting beginnings of discovering what 3D could deliver to gamers. Emulation preserves this pioneering era while contemporary enhancements make the experiences more accessible and enjoyable today. The 4th generation established a foundation all following ones would build on top of.
