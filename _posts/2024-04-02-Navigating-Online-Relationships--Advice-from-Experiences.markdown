## ### Meeting Someone Online
A friend recently shared their experience of meeting someone online and starting to chat regularly. While keeping an open mind to new connections is important, it's also crucial to be cautious when getting to know someone solely through online interactions. In the early stages, asking for additional ways to communicate like social media profiles or a phone number can help establish more trust than just chatting on a dating app. Verifying shared connections or researching publicly available information about a match can offer reassurance that interactions are proceeding safely.

## ### Maintaining Communication from A Distance 
It's understandable that life gets busy and maintaining constant communication with online matches can be tricky, especially if living in different locations. However, consistently lackluster or no responses over extended periods may indicate waning interest level. Suggesting video chats or phone calls could help sustain interactions when schedules conflict. Being upfront about communication preferences and availability circumvents potential confusion down the line. Checking-in occasionally if contact was lost for a valid reason shows care without coming across as overbearing. 
## ### Signs of Catfishing or Scams
Sadly, not everyone interacts online with honest intentions. Beware of excuses to dodge meeting in person after weeks of online chatting or unusual requests for money, gifts or excessive personal details early on. Taking time to do reverse image searches of photos shared and looking for inconsistencies in backstories over multiple conversations can help identify potential catfishing situations. Trusting instincts if something feels off despite explanations is important for safety. Ending contact respectfully is best if suspicions cannot be alleviated.
## ### Managing Expectations Early On  
Having fun getting to know new people is exciting but not a reason to make assumptions about where things may lead. Assume multiple people are being dated casually unless exclusivity is clearly established. Expressing interest does not obligate either party to continual communication or a relationship. Not investing too heavily emotionally prevents hurt when interests do not align. Continuing to interact with others casually avoids over-relying on any single match too soon when long-term potential has yet to be determined.  
## ### Communication is Key
Honest, open dialogue fosters understanding between potential partners. Discussing involvement with others respectfully establishes trust instead of fueling insecurity. Listen without judgment to a match's perspective and circumstances. Check-in occasionally on each other's well-being and where the online interaction may be heading. Share honestly any desire to slow communication without pressuring the other person. Expressing emotions in a balanced, solution-focused way builds connection.  
## ### Trust Your Gut 
No one deserves dishonesty or feeling like a low priority option. If consistent signs point to being misled or blown off regularly, ignoring intuition out of hopes for what could be risks greater hurt later. Prioritize self-worth by walking away from situations lacking effort or sincerity from both parties. Continue searching for people exhibiting reciprocal care and commitment to get to know each other better mutually. Your energy deserves valuing through supportive connections.
## ### Making an Online Connection Offline
Exchanging numbers and making plans to meetup if reasonably possible cultivates stronger ties. However, avoiding hastily accepting money, gifts or invitations until in-person introduction ensures caution. A real-life interaction provides opportunity to determine if the bond translates offline or was confined to virtual interactions alone. Try low-pressure, public activities like coffee initially. Comfort levels dictate pacing for physical intimacy, but pressing before readiness sours trust built so far. Patience and clarity fosters healthy developments. 
## ### Managing Jealousy
Unless exclusivity was mutually established upfront, it's unrealistic to expect dates to refrain from interactions with others. Focus on self-growth instead of attempts to monitor or control partners. Communicate thoughtfully about insecurities without attacking their choices or independence. Work diligently on trusting your worth does not depend on anyone else's actions. Letting go of unrealistic expectations breeds inner peace and healthier relationships. Bottling emotions invites unnecessary drama - talking things through respectfully clears air.
## ### Know Your Boundaries  
Have clear standards for how you want to be treated and end interactions crossing lines. Trust intuition on levels of involvement with different people. Prioritize building enriching connections exhibiting care, honesty and respect. Your happiness matters most - invest energy in matches enhancing life not causing distress. Settling tolerates less than deserved. Walk away from mismatches values without second guessing self-worth. You choose greatness through boundaries empowering healthy bonds.
