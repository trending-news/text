## Introduction
Sony's PlayStation digital storefront offers convenience for gamers, but what happens if a game is removed? Can games still be downloaded if no longer listed on the store? This guide will answer whether previously purchased PlayStation Store titles can still be accessed in your game library.
### Researching Purchase History
When making digital purchases on PlayStation, all transactions are recorded in your account's purchase history. This serves as an important tool for accessing games even if their store pages disappear later on. The purchase history retains a full record of all paid downloads, allowing games to be redownloaded at any time without relying on an active store listing.

### Exceptions to the Rule
While most previously purchased games will remain downloadable through purchase history, there are some exceptions. Developers occasionally request games be wholly removed from PlayStation's distribution systems. One rare example is the "PT" demo by Hideo Kojima, pulled at his studio's closure. Without the files still hosted on Sony's servers, it became impossible for past owners to reinstall. 
### Maintaining Access with PlayStation Plus  
PlayStation Plus acts as a valuable backup for digital games accessed through the service's monthly "free" titles. As long as an active PS+ membership is maintained, all previously downloaded Plus games will stay accessible from the online game library. This ensures gamers can continue playing a title, even if the store page later disappears.
### Backwards Compatibility on New Hardware
Another benefit is how PlayStation handles backwards compatibility. Games bought for older PlayStation consoles - like PS1, PS2 or PS3 - that have PlayStation Store versions, can usually still be downloaded on newer hardware. This provides access even when the original purchase was for a since discontinued system. Of course, hardware limitations mean PlayStation 5 will not run every previous generation game.
### Extra Safety with External Storage
To keep local copies safe from any future store access issues, it's wise to backup digital games through external hard drives or memory cards. Storing title files externally protects the ability to reinstall, even without an internet connection later on. As storage space increases, maintaining local archives is a straightforward safety net for one's digital game library.
### Reviewing Purchase History Regularly  
Gamers should routinely check their purchase histories, just in case a missing store page isn't really a delisting. Re-downloading from account activity logs is often the easiest solution. It's also a good idea to maintain active PlayStation Plus membership for continued access to past "free" monthly games. Taking these basic steps helps maximize the lifespan of a digital game library.
### Conclusion
In the vast majority of cases, yes - games can still be downloaded if they were previously purchased digitally on PlayStation Store. Exceptions do arise when developers actively remove games from PlayStation's servers entirely. But purchase histories, PlayStation Plus, backwards compatibility and external storage backups provide reliable options to preserve access long-term in most situations. With a little care, gamers can feel secure continuing to enjoy their expansive digital collections for years to come.
## Issues Resolving Missing Purchases 
Occasionally, gamers may encounter issues re-downloading a purchase that shows in their history. The most common problems tend to involve regional storefront mismatches, payment disputes, or PSN account region switches. In these situations, contacting PlayStation support is important to help resolve what went wrong.
Representatives can investigate transactions, verify license ownership, and determine the root cause of a missing purchase. They have access to deeper records than the consumer-facing purchase history. Often a simple account check or issue correction is needed to restore proper access. While not a perfect system, PlayStation customer service aims to properly address problems and ensure past digital buys remain usable as intended.
## Regional Storefront Considerations
PlayStation digital purchases are tied to the specific region's online store they were bought through. So games acquired on the North American PSN will not show under a European account, and vice versa. This becomes important if one changes their system's region later or merges regional wallets. Contacting support in such cases allows checking purchase history across borders if need be. Proper region matching is key for smooth cross-catalog access when hardware or accounts switch locales down the line.
## Contacting Support for Missing Purchases
The first step for any missing previously bought game should always be closely examining one's purchase history for signs it was removed incorrectly. If still unseen after thorough checks, the next course is contacting PlayStation support through official channels. Live chat, phone lines, and help websites provide options to submit tickets for further investigation. Include as many specific details as possible about the missing title and transaction to aid their research process. Patience may be needed, but representatives want to help restore rightful access to one's paid digital library whenever possible.
## Conclusion
While digital purchases do come with certain risks not present with physical media, PlayStation and its support staff strive to honor past buys as able. Routine access checks, keeping local copies, maintaining active PS+ and working with customer service form a solid foundation for continued enjoyment of one's game library over time. With diligence, gamers can feel confident investing in PlayStation Store, knowing their hours of play past, present and future look to remain safely accessible for years to come.
