### Introduction
The Xbox Series line offers gamers two main console options - the Xbox Series S and the more powerful Xbox Series X. Both consoles represent Microsoft's newest generation of hardware and provide access to the latest Xbox games. However, there are some key differences between the two that are important to understand before making a purchase decision. This post will compare the Xbox Series S vs Series X across various factors like hardware specs, storage, performance and more to help determine which console might be the best fit based on individual needs and budget.

### Hardware Specifications 
At first glance, the Xbox Series X is clearly the more powerful machine. It has support for true 4K gaming at up to 120 frames per second, thanks to its robust 12 teraflop GPU and custom SSD. The CPU also delivers 4x the processing power of the Xbox One generation for faster gameplay. In comparison, while still a great upgrade, the Series S is targeted at delivering gameplay at 1440p resolution at 60fps. It has a smaller and less powerful CPU and GPU optimized for those frequencies. Additionally, the Series X comes with a 4K Blu-ray disc drive, allowing users to play physical game discs. However, the Series S is an all-digital console, meaning game purchases must be made online through the Microsoft Store.
### Games and Backwards Compatibility
Both the Series X and Series S are fully backwards compatible, meaning you can play thousands of Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One games on them. However, where the Series X really differentiates is in its ability to potentially enhance many older titles to take advantage of its powerful hardware. Some supported games may see upgrades like increased resolution, higher and more stable framerates, faster loading times and even some visual enhancements. Only the Series X allows you to play physical game discs from past Xbox generations as well. Series S owners will need to repurchase any older games in digital formats to access backwards compatible titles.
### Storage and Memory
When it comes to onboard storage, there is a clear difference between the Xbox Series S and X. The Series S comes with only 512GB of useable SSD storage compared to the 1TB SSD fitted inside the Series X. This can become an issue quite quickly considering modern games regularly exceed 50-100GB in size. Users may find themselves needing to juggle installed titles more often on the Series S to manage storage. Thankfully, both consoles now support expandable storage via proprietary expansion cards compatible with their Velocity Architecture. However, these cards do not come cheap, with 1TB models currently retailing at around $219 USD.
### Value and Cost of Games
The Xbox Series S has an undeniably lower list price of $299 compared to the $499 price tag of the Series X. For those on a budget, this discount can be very attractive. However, the lack of a disc drive means users have to purchase all games digitally through the Microsoft Store. This cuts out the ability to find cheaper used physical copies of games or later reselling titles you finish. Over the long run, continuing to buy new games digitally may end up costing more than taking advantage of disc-based sales and cheaper pre-owned games available for the Series X. Of course, Game Pass subscribers have access to a large library at a monthly rate which helps offset these additional digital game costs on the Series S.
### Display Options
The Xbox Series line offers flexibility in how players can enjoy games on supported displays. However, the Series X is clearly optimized and designed for high-end 4K televisions and monitors capable of 60Hz or 120Hz output. It promises true 4K gaming potential at 60 or even 120fps for supported titles. On the other hand, while still delivering a significant upgrade over last-gen, the Series S is focused on delivering gameplay at 1440p and targeting lower to mid-range displays at 60Hz without compromising visual quality too much. So those without a 4K screen but planning an upgrade in the next few years may find the Series X a better long term investment for when they do transition to 4K.
### Performance and Future-Proofing 
With significantly more powerful internals, the Xbox Series X enjoys a clear advantage over the Series S when it comes to raw performance and future-proofing capabilities. Its stronger components ensure next-gen textures, lighting effects and other demanding gameplay features will not be a struggle for the system to handle smoothly even several years down the line. As developers continue unleashing the full potential of new gaming technologies, some titles may end up not fully utilizing the Series S hardware to preserve compatibility. Game and hardware resources may get primarily focused on the Series X first. So those seeking a console that can smoothly sail through the entire next-gen lifespan without concerns of aging hardware may want to opt for the more powerful Series X.
### Verdict  
For most users, the best Xbox console will largely depend on individual priorities, budget and gaming needs. The Xbox Series S is a budget-friendly entry point into next-gen with good value for casual gamers and those without access to a 4K display yet. However, those planning to seriously invest in the upcoming generation of games, expecting to be on the platform for several years, seeking the best visual fidelity, performance or want the flexibility of disc drive, used game options and future-proofing should strongly consider the more powerful Xbox Series X. Both deliver amazing upgrades, and the decision comes down to weighing features against cost.
