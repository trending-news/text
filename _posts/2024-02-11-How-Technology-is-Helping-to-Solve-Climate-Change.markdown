For example, smart thermostats automatically adjust temperature settings when occupants leave to save on heating and cooling costs. Advanced LED lighting controlled by motion sensors or apps further shrink energy use in buildings. Infrastructure upgrades like smart grids supported by digital infrastructure enable two-way communication between utilities and consumers. Systems such as these make energy consumption highly visible, encouraging voluntary conservation efforts. Combined with building retrofits using more insulating windows and climate-friendly HVAC systems, smart technologies are enabling significant reductions in carbon footprints across residential and commercial real estate.  
### Powering Down the Digital Revolution 
As our reliance on digital devices and cloud infrastructure grows exponentially each year, managing energy use associated with information technologies becomes ever more critical. Data centers in particular consume vast amounts of electricity to power servers and storage systems. Technology companies are working hard to build facilities that optimize efficiency through techniques like liquid cooling, free cooling via outside air, and utilizing waste heat. Adapting data center designs for maximum efficiency helps offset rising energy demands of ubiquitous cloud services and artificial intelligence. Consumer devices themselves have evolved to sip rather than gulp electricity through low-power processors, efficient charging, and longer battery runtimes between charges. Overall the digital revolution's growing appetite for energy is being addressed through ingenious efficiency boosting approaches across industries, moderating climate impacts amid increasing connectivity.
## Lowering Carbon in Heavy Industries
### Capturing Carbon Before it Releases
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology aims to prevent carbon dioxide emissions from heavily polluting industries like coal and natural gas power plants from entering the atmosphere. The concept involves utilizing chemical processes to separate and capture CO2 from flue gases at combustion sources. The isolated CO2 is then compressed for transportation through pipelines to secure geologic reservoirs such as exhausted oil and gas fields or deep saline aquifers where it can be trapped indefinitely. Although expensive currently, scaling up CCS could potentially capture over 90% of emissions from large industrial facilities. If developed and deployed at a global level commensurate with scientific recommendations, carbon capture and storage could potentially reduce CO2 levels in the atmosphere significantly over time. Research continues on improving and optimizing CCS techniques to bring costs down and support integrating the technology across heavy industry.
### Clean(er) Heavy Transport Takes Off
Emissions from global cargo shipping and aviation account for a sizable portion of industrial carbon pollution. Here alternatives are emerging such as biofuels derived from sustainably-grown feedstocks. Various carriers from aircraft manufacturers like Boeing are testing so-called "sustainable aviation fuels" aimed at reducing aviation's climate footprint. Meanwhile across commercial shipping fleets, other biofuels as well as liquified natural gas present options for cleaning up oceangoing transport linked to international trade. Early adoption especially on high-traffic shipping routes indicates cleaner marine fuels may gradually replace conventional bunker oil over time. Combined with efficiency improvements through advanced hull designs and engine technologies these renewable and lower-carbon fuel switches seek to lessen emissions from heavy transport industries critical to globalized commerce.
## Smart, Sustainable Food Systems 
### Optimizing Resources on the Farm 
Precision agriculture leverages information technologies to optimize agricultural resource use through precisely targeted inputs. GPS-enabled tools and sensors guide precise seeding, watering and fertilizer application catered to local soil conditions. Digitally-mapped fields reveal microclimates and nutrient deficiencies to help farmers boost yields with minimal waste. Drones and computer vision add more data layers to pinpoint crop health issues for early intervention. When combined with conservative tillage that preserves soil carbon, precision approaches promote sustainable intensification of food production. Their widespread adoption supports feeding a growing global population with fewer agricultural emissions.
### Producing Food Locally, Vertically  
Modern controlled-environment agriculture takes food production indoors and vertical. Hydroponic and aquaponic greenhouses grow fresher leafy greens, berries and herbs with up to ten times the yield per acre compared to traditional farms. By locating these facilities near population centers in retrofitted buildings, vertical farms significantly reduce transportation emissions associated with conventional agriculture. Their precise nutrient dosing and climate control also maximize crop yields year-round while avoiding chemical pesticides and fertilizers. Some facilities even power themselves with solar panels atop greenhouses. Advanced indoor agriculture offers a complementary path toward more localized, sustainable and resilient food systems especially in urban environments.
## Optimizing the Grid and Beyond
