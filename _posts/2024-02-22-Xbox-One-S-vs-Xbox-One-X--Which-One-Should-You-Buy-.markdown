## Design
### Xbox One S Design  
At just 6.1 pounds and 27% smaller in size, the Xbox One S ditched the large external power supply used in the original console. Its sleek matte black design fits neatly into any entertainment center. The compact casing makes it an attractive option for those with limited space.
### Xbox One X Design
The Xbox One X maintains the similar style cues as its predecessors but with a more substantial presence. At roughly twice the size and weight of the One S, it houses significantly upgraded internal components for advanced 4K gaming. Its measured dimensions of 6 inches tall by 11.8 inches wide exemplify its focus on premium performance over compact design.
## 4K Gaming
### 4K on Xbox One S
While the One S supports 4K video playback from streaming services or Ultra HD Blu-ray discs, it cannot output games natively in 4K resolution. Games are upscaled to 4K if played on a compatible 4K display but run internally at a lower resolution. 
### Native 4K Gaming on Xbox One X  
Powered by a custom processor and 12GB of high-speed GDDR5 RAM, the Xbox One X delivers true 4K gaming. Select games are optimized to run natively at 3840x2160 pixels for ultra-sharp visuals. Its significant processing muscle allows rendering scenes and effects at 4x the resolution of full HD for unprecedented image quality.
## Hardware Specifications
### Xbox One S Hardware
Equipped with an octa-core 1.75GHz processor and 8GB of DDR3 RAM, the One S represented a modest upgrade over the original hardware. Its storage options include a 500GB or 1TB HDD for installing games and apps.
### Xbox One X Hardware 
Under the hood, the One X packs a significantly mightier punch. A 2.3GHz octa-core CPU is paired with 12GB of faster GDDR5 RAM. Its 1TB solid state drive offers faster load times. Plus, its integrated 6 teraflop GPU allows demanding 4K workloads. These premium internals translate to enhanced visuals and smoother gameplay.
## Price
### Xbox One S Price
The Xbox One S sells for $299 for the 500GB model or $329 with 1TB of storage. For those seeking an affordable entry into the current Xbox ecosystem, it provides solid value and functionality.
### Xbox One X Price  
At $499, the price of admission is steeper for the Xbox One X. However, that higher cost unlocks a true 4K gaming experience on a compatible TV. For individuals who game regularly on a 4K display, the visual splendor may be worth the premium outlay.
## Upgrading from Original Xbox One
### Upgrading to Xbox One S
For owners of the original Xbox One, the streamlined chassis and support for 4K video make the One S an ideal upgrade choice if your budget is tight. Load times see decent improvements as well. 
### Upgrading to Xbox One X
Gamers fully invested in taking their console experience to the next level will appreciate the enormous leap in power delivered by the One X. 4K gaming, expanded performance headroom, and a host of optimized titles make it the top pick for those ready to maximize their setup.
## Having an Xbox One Already 
### Upgrading an Older Xbox One
If the original console owned is showing its age with slower loads or more sluggish gameplay, the internal boosts inside the One S can help reinvigorate the experience. Its space-saving design proves an added perk.
### Saving for the Xbox One X  
Unless the existing Xbox One is notably outdated, most users are better off skipping the One S and setting aside funds for the fully-fledged power of the One X down the road. Its capabilities represent a much bigger generational jump.
## Consider Your Television
### Sticking with Xbox One S on a 1080p Display  
For individuals still gaming on a 1080p/Full HD TV, the One S strikes an ideal balance. It allows taking full advantage of today's library while preparing for an inevitable 4K upgrade later on.
### Future-Proofing with the Xbox One X
Gamers who foresee upgrading their display to 4K in the next few years stand to gain long-term from the One X's peerless 4K output. But a 4K/HDR TV is required to fully unlock its potential for lifelike graphics.
## Conclusion
Both the Xbox One S and Xbox One X offer compelling value depending on individual circumstances. Factor in display resolution, typical gaming sessions, and budget to determine the right Xbox. There are no wrong choices - just options tailored to suit diverse player needs, budgets and home entertainment configurations. With wonderful exclusive games and competitive online, these consoles deliver incredible entertainment value for any true gamer.
