The battle royale genre finds its inspiration from the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale. In the film, the Japanese government forces school classes to fight to the death annually as a way to control rebellious youth. Though a work of fiction, it planted the seed of a new multiplayer concept where many players fight in a last-man-standing deathmatch. Modders for games like Minecraft and ARMA 2 were inspired to create early battle royale modes in the late 2000s and early 2010s. These early mods helped pioneer the core battle royale mechanics and prove there was interest for a dedicated game in the genre.
### PUBG Takes the Genre Mainstream 
Released in 2017, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, took the battle royale genre and popularized it on a massive scale. Developed and published by PUBG Corporation and Bluehole, PUBG built upon the foundation laid by mods to create the most fully realized game in the format to date. Up to 100 players would parachute onto maps like Erangel and Miramar from aircraft flying over the islands. On landing, players would loot towns and buildings for weapons and supplies to gear up. The goal was to eliminate all other players through any means possible while staying inside a continuously shrinking safe zone. PUBG streamlined the looting, combat and progression and fine-tuned the pacing of matches. This, combined with the intensity and tension of competing on a massive scale, drew in millions of players and allowed battle royale gaming to break into the mainstream.

### New Intensity Through Numbers and Zones
A key innovation PUBG brought to battle royale gaming was scale - up to 100 players in a single match battling to the last man standing created an intensity unlike any traditional multiplayer game. With so many competitors, constantly having to watch your back kept players on their toes from the opening seconds. The ever-closing safe zones were another brilliant tactic that ramped up pressure. Forcing players together as the play space shrunk ensured encounters instead of players getting stuck outside the invisible barriers. Random air drops of high-powered weapons into matches added an element of risk and reward as players had to venture into dangerous areas for powerful gear. These key features gave PUBG a frenetic pace of tense showdowns that hooked millions.
### Unprecedented Success 
The popularity of PUBG after its 2017 launch grew exponentially through word of mouth and prominent streamers. Within a year it had sold over 50 million copies across PC and consoles, making it one of the best-selling games of all time. The dedicated players it accumulated are reported to have exceeded over 400 million globally. Such immense success proved just how appealing the battle royale genre could be when fully realized. PUBG single-handedly popped the format into mainstream gaming consciousness and inspired countless developers to try their hand at making battle royale titles of their own. It showed how highly- replayable gameplay of many squads endlessly competing drew in audiences far larger than most multiplayer games could manage.
### Modding DayZ for a New Genre
Behind PUBG’s stratospheric rise was its lead designer and creator, Brendan Greene, known as PlayerUnknown. Greene cut his teeth as a modder, starting with the online zombie survival game DayZ in 2012. For DayZ, he created the Battle Royale mod where players fought in deathmatches with collapsing zones. Though inspired by the Japanese film, his mod gave hardcore players in DayZ’s community a more PvP-based mode to enjoy. It was hugely popular and proved there was an appetite for a standalone battle royale experience. Greene left DayZ development to form his own studio, where he produced PUBG and brought the mod’s concepts to their fullest form backed by big studio support. His Battle Royale mod showed, with the right game backing it, a new multiplayer genre could flourish.
### Erangel, Miramar, Vikendi and More
One of PUBG’s strengths was variety in environments. At launch it contained the sprawling 8x8km Erangel map, dotted with towns, forests and fields. Over time it expanded with the more vertical and cinematic desert island of Miramar and snowy Eastern European landscape of Vikendi. Each brought new strategic metas to matches with their own terrains, compounds and zones. Erangel remains the classic battleground while later maps offered fresh scenery. Additional modes like smaller maps and night versions mixed up gameplay. Custom match settings addedControlOptions for custom games too. With its selectionof diverse maps along regular map rotations, PUBG ensuredmatches stayed interestingthrough frequent changesof scenery.
### Matches and Progression Over 30 Minutes
A typical PUBG match followed a consistent flow over around 30 minutes. Players would ready up and load into the pre-game plane ride overviewing the 8x8km or larger maps. Upon reaching the play zone, all would parachute out and rush to named locations to loot. Weapons varied from pickaxes and pans early to sniper rifles and assault rifles later. After gearing up came the tense free-for-all where survival depended on sound tactics. As the safe zone closed in phases, the chaos came to a head in final circles of 10 players or less vying desperately for the Chicken Dinner. Beyond wins, in-game BP currency unlocked cosmetic apparel like shirts and options to buy random item crates for outfits. Event modes offered alternative rulesets outside the standard playlists.
### Battle Royale Was Just Getting Started
Despite PUBG pioneering the genre in a commercial release, its success was merely the beginning. By showing battle royale's incredible potential, PUBG invited competition aiming to topple its throne. Epic Games' free-to-play Fortnite started as a conventional multiplayer shooter but overhauled to a battle royale format in 2017. Its vibrant art style and building mechanics set it apart while maintaining the PUBG blueprint. Fortnite thrived as perhaps an even bigger phenomenon, pressuring PUBG to improve. Meanwhile, other major releases like Call of Duty: Black Ops 4's Blackout mode and EA's Apex Legends brought new spins to keep things fresh. Battle royale proved itself here to stay as a dominant force, transforming the shooter landscape thanks to PUBG's groundwork.
### Revolutionizing Multiplayer Gaming 
Looking back, few could deny PUBG's influence in revitalizing online multiplayer during the 2010s. By breathing new life into a tired genre through battle royale's novel mechanics, it engaged audiences like no other. Where most shooters pitted players in team deathmatches of 6-12, PUBG pitted 100 against each in a climactic free-for-all. Its melding of looting, crafting and survival elements also brought RPG fans into competitive shooters. Above all, it delivered non-stop emergent moments no developer could write from constantly shifting 100-player sandboxes. With millions engaging in its intensity daily, battle royale reshaped expectations for online games. By decade's end, its indelible mark revolutionized what multiplayer meant as the most played style worldwide. PUBG's vision changed the industry by starting it all and deserves its place among the most influential shooters in history.
