## Overview
PlayStation allows users great flexibility in managing their game library. Games can be deleted from the system to free up storage space or remove unneeded titles. While deleting removes future access, flexibility exists to redownload titles when wanted. Let's explore the full capabilities for customizing your game collection.
### Removing Access to Play Games
The PlayStation library manager enables deleting individual games. This removes the title from the installed software but provides no refund. Future play requires repurchasing. Some publishers restrict deleting due to copyright protections. Hidden titles remain accessible unlike deleted ones.

## Deleting Games Step-by-Step
To remove a game, start in the Library section of your PS console or app. Select the offending title and open the options menu. The delete command permanently erases the software installation files and updates. Confirmation prevents accidental removals. Finished titles, platinumed trophies, and uninstalled simply don't take up space. 
### Confirm Removal of the Game Files  
Once selected, a prompt appears requiring confirmation the game will be unplayable without redownloading. This serves as a safeguard against unintended deletions that could cost money to replace purchased content. With a tap of confirm, the title exits the library for good unless repurchased.
## Effects of Removing Games
Deleting a title succeeds in uninstalling it entirely. No saved data, screenshots, captured videos or trophies remain associated once removed. The software license restricting redistribution is also wiped. Rebuying allows downloading again later when space opens up or interest returns. Some digital entitlements cannot actually delete however.
### Restricted Deletion of Certain Purchases
While flexible, deletion policies exist to uphold copyright and prevent used game resales that could undermine new sales. Certain "always-on" online games and those without physical discs may not permit full removal from the library either. Hidden is preferable to deleted in such cases.
## Alternative to Permanent Deletion: Hiding Games
For disk-based games or digital licenses without the option to delete, PlayStation offers an alternative way to manage library clutter. Hidden titles remain accessible through the library search or purchase history but don't clutter the main display. This provides flexibility without risk of losing future access.
### Keep Purchased Content Accessible Without Clutter
Hiding serves as reversible removal from the main view. It neither deletes save files nor uninstalls games. Later, hidden titles can be made visible again quickly when mood strikes to replay. Combined with deleting fully uninstalling others, hiding customizes the software library nondestructively. 
## Common Questions About removing Games
Frequently asked questions help explain the ins and outs of deleting purchased games. Importantly, no refund is provided since the content was already paid for and used. Deleting also does not impact online/multiplayer access or trophies/achievements already earned in a title.
### No Compensation for Purchased Content
While uninstalling reclaims storage space, Sony does not reimburse the original purchase since the software was accessed. Some deleted games like those requiring online validation may even redownload small files preventing true removal. flexibility comes at the cost of a clean slate.
## Additional Points to Know
Beyond the core deletion functionality, related aspects impact library management. Deleted games eliminate only the installed files, not separate saved data which must also be deleted manually if wanted gone for good. Using multiple accounts complicates reinstalls as each requires downloading anew.
### Consider Saved Data and Multiple Accounts
Deleting a title from the library succeeds in removing only the installed program. To fully wipe all evidence of play, saved games and other user data files must be deleted separately in the settings. Downloads also apply individually per account, so sharing a console means redownloading across user profiles.
## Permanence and Recovery After Deletion
Once a purchased game leaves the library, it cannot be undone without repurchasing access. No operating system features restore deleted items nondestructively. Additionally, deleting a PSN account destroys not just games but the entire purchase/download history and other details forever without backups. 
### Deleted Accounts and Games Are Gone Forever  
Sony's digital libraries handle deletions destructively without a recycle bin. Removed items, save data, and entire accounts containing purchased licenses dissolve irretrievably afterward. Physical discs allow continued access if reinserted but resetting deletes all digital entitlements permanently without compensation if mistakes occur.
## Flexibility with Owned Content
While deletion feels daunting due to warnings of permanence, legally obtained games provide lasting flexibility. Disk games continue playing through inserted media. Downloaded digital games reinstall freely from the purchase history whenever storage permits. Ownership endures through hardware/account changes.
### Freedom with purchased software
Within copyright and platform limitations, purchased games become personal property. This allows reinstalling, deleting, redownloading or even disposing of physical media at will like any owned software. Digital storefront licensing replicates ownership flexibilities of physical media for convenience within set platform,account and copyright rules.
In summary, managing PlayStation libraries requires understanding deletion consequences but provides useful tools. Titles no longer needed free up space while hidden titles stay available. Redownloading replaces deleted games. With care, the digital model replicates physical media flexibilities through purchase history functionality.
