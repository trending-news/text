### Why keep your old consoles
Many Nintendo fans recommend holding onto classic systems like the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) due to the strong sense of nostalgia they invoke as well as their extensive libraries of beloved games. While selling old hardware may seem like an easy way to earn some quick cash, the reality is that individual consoles and loose cartridges don't tend to fetch very high prices in the current retro game market. Given the low potential financial returns, combined with the personal enjoyment and memories these systems can continue to provide for years to come, it's often best to keep ones childhood consoles.

### Condition is key for collector value
For those Nintendo consoles and games that do carry higher monetary value in the collection scene, it's important to note that condition is crucial. Systems that remain in their original packaging with all inserts, manuals, and accessories intact will command the most attention and dollars from serious retro gamers. Loose cartridges on their own have far less worth unless pertaining to especially rare titles. Keeping one's retro finds in the best shape possible can make a big difference if choosing to someday part with prized possessions. 
### Quick cash isn't worth parting with nostalgia 
While the desire to earn some quick cash is understandable, most enthusiasts agree that selling common classic systems like the SNES likely won't net a large payout, making it not really worthwhile. There are usually easier ways to earn money that don't involve parting with items full of memories from one's childhood. Systems like the Super Nintendo in particular still remain fairly attainable price-wise in the current market. For most fans, it's better to continue enjoying the excellent games in one's own collection rather than attempting to profit off of sentimental items.
### Dig out classics for more enjoyment over uncertain profits
Rather than selling nostalgic Nintendo hardware and software, many retro aficionados recommend simply playing them. After all, what's the point of giving up a beloved console when one can continue experiencing those classic 16-bit adventures of yesteryear that sparked such joy in the first place. Diving back into games like Super Mario World or The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past offers more genuine satisfaction than any potential profits could. Retro consoles remain quite affordable too, making gameplay a wise choice over uncertain marketplace earnings. 
### Don't expect major long term price increases 
While some especially rare Nintendo and video game collectibles have seen large increases in value over decades, this isn't usually the case for once common systems. The SNES for example still remains widely available and affordable due to its enormous install base during the 1990s. Additionally, factors like emulation solutions have impacted what physical retro products are worth. Most experts agree that standard classic consoles aren't likely to hugely rise in price years from now, so holding out solely for larger future profits isn't a sound strategy. Sentimental value and ongoing enjoyment of one's existing collection carry more weight.
### Finding consoles new homes with other fans 
For those who do decide to part with beloved retro hardware, it's best to aim to place systems with owners who will truly appreciate them rather than random purchasers or used game shops. Passionate video game collectors will often pay fair prices for complete, excellent condition setups including rare variants, since these items hold personal meaning beyond dollar amounts. Posting one's classics for sale amongst dedicated retro communities allows finding cherished consoles new homes with fans who will treasure them as much as their original owners once did.
### Don't dwell on regrettable console sales
If difficult financial circumstances previously forced the sale of prized systems, it's best not to remain forever unhappy about past decisions out of necessity. While it can be sad to no longer possess childhood consoles, there are usually affordable current options that can tap into similar nostalgia. The Nintendo Switch for example allows enjoying revamped NES and SNES titles through services like Nintendo Switch Online. And the Switch library continues growing with many indie spiritual successors to classic series. There's no need to dwell on past regrets when new ways to recapture retro joy exist. 
### Alternatives to missing classic Nintendo systems
For those who never owned or have since lost prized consoles like the original Nintendo Entertainment System, several affordable alternatives exist today to still experience those games. Online auction sites and local used game stores may occasionally have systems pop up for sale. Otherwise, the NES and SNES Mini Classic systems deliver flawless emulated play of fan favorites on a budget. And the Switch Online services provide huge libraries of downloadable 8-bit and 16-bit titles. With some patience and searching, it's still possible for modern gamers to access classics they missed out on during childhood.
### Personal enjoyment outweighs monetary worth 
At the end of the day for most longtime Nintendo fans, consoles, cartridges, and other retro memorabilia carry meaning that greatly exceeds any financial value. Childhood mementos representing formative joy and adventure hold sentimental worth beyond dollar amounts. For this reason, many advise either keeping classic systems for one's own continued fun or passing them down to family who will appreciate gaming history. There are usually better ways to earn money than parting with such personally priceless possessions. Donating or retaining consoles seems preferable to attempting to uncertainly profit off of items full of rich memories and nostalgia.
