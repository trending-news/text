### Checking Storage on PS4 and PS4 Pro
The PS4 and PS4 Pro provide an easy way to check your storage directly from the system settings. To access it, navigate to Settings > Storage. Here you'll find an overview of how much space is used on the console's internal storage as well as any extended storage connected via USB. You can delete saved game content, apps and move games between storage devices. Additionally, you have control over where new downloads are installed by default.

### Checking Storage on PS3  
Checking available storage on PS3 isn't as straightforward as the PS4, but can still be found within the system settings menu. Navigate to Settings > System Settings > System Information. The free space remaining will be displayed next to "Free Space". For a breakdown of what's using space, check the relevant sections like photos, music, videos and game saves in the XMB menu. Knowing how much space is left prevents issues with saving games.
### Reasons Saving May Fail
While saving games should generally work without issue, there are some potential culprits if it runs into problems. The most common is simply running out of storage space on the console or storage device. System level bugs can sometimes block saving altogether until resolved. Some game settings may restrict when and how saves can happen. Incompatible titles could struggle with the console's save system as well. If issues pop up, contacting Sony support is the best path to determining a fix.
### Local Multiplayer Options 
Gamers don't need to go online to enjoy multiplayer - many titles support connecting multiple controllers on the same console. Local multiplayer is a fun way for family and friends to compete side by side. Common examples are fighting game versus modes and local co-op in shooters or sports games. While only one person controls the game at a time, others can quickly swap in using additional controllers.
### Discovering Free Games
Both new and hidden gem free-to-play games can be discovered on PlayStation platforms. Creating a PSN account allows browsing the PlayStation Store. Use search filters like "Free Games" to find untouched indie titles and popular game demos at no cost. No payment details are even required to download and enjoy these games on PS4, PS5 or other Sony consoles. It's a great low-commitment way to experience new genres and hidden gems.
### Transferring Updates Between Consoles
Game updates downloaded on one PlayStation usually need to be redownloaded fully when playing on another console. However, by transferring just the updated game data files to an external hard drive, this content can be accessed on a second system instead of redownloading the whole update. Make sure to store any local game saves separately to avoid issues, as those data are console-specific.
### PlayStation Exclusives
Many of gaming's most acclaimed and influential franchises originated as PlayStation exclusives, helping define each new Sony platform. From God of War and Spiderman to Gran Turismo and Uncharted, these Story-Driven series transported players to immersive worlds only possible on PlayStation. While some have seen PC releases, PlayStation consoles were where these acclaimed universes were first experienced. Exclusives continue attracting new players to this day.
### Revisiting PS1 Classics
For those nostalgic for the original PlayStation, there are still affordable ways to go back and experience the system's iconic library. Finding a used PS1 console runs $40-50 nowadays. Games themselves start at under $5 each online. For the true retro feel, nothing rivals playing on the original hardware. Remastered ports of PS1 games are also available digitally for PS4 to enjoy classics with modern enhancements. Going back is a fun trip down memory lane.
### Top Recommended PS1 Games
Some of the most beloved PlayStation games still hold up today for good reason. Driver: You Are the Wheelman combined cinematic storytelling with intuitive driving controls in its open world. Time Crisis and Twisted Metal 2: World Tour perfected the light-gun and vehicular combat genres. Final Fantasy Tactics and Einhander married deep strategy with epic stories and soundtracks. Then there's evergreen franchises like Spider-Man, Tenchu: Stealth Assassins and Ridge Racer Type 4 - all influential titles that helped propel the new 3D generation of gaming forward. These classics are well worth seeking out for any PlayStation fan.
