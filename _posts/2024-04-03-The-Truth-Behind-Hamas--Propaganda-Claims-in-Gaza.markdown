## Introduction 
Hamas claims victory in their recent conflict with Israel, but the facts tell a different story. Their propaganda dominates international headlines, painting a story of Israeli aggression against innocent Gazans. However, a closer look shows that Hamas is losing on the ground and inflating civilian casualties to gain sympathy.
### Truth Over Falsehoods
While Hamas celebrates misleading "victories", Israel achieved important strategic goals by degrading Hamas' military capabilities. Independent investigations must cut through Hamas' lies to find the real truth of what happened in Gaza.

## Hamas Won the Media Battle But Lost on the Battlefield
### Staging Fake Propaganda 
Hamas staged fake hostage releases and civilian deaths for media photos. Journalists failed to verify these claims, amplifying Hamas propaganda worldwide. In reality, Israel's operation succeeded in its aims of limiting Hamas abilities to threaten Israeli civilians. 
### Israel Achieved Strategic Goals
Though Hamas wants the world to believe otherwise, Israel crippled Hamas infrastructure, uncovered attack-tunnels, and removed key leaders from the battlefield. These significant blows will hinder Hamas' ability to attack Israel for years.
## Hamas Inflated Civilian Casualty Numbers 
### Counting Terrorists as Civilians
To gain international sympathy, Hamas counts any males aged 16-65 killed in Gaza as civilian casualties, regardless of whether they were actually terrorists. Independent analyses show over 10,000 Hamas fighters died defending military positions and infrastructure.
### Thousands of Hamas Fighters Perished  
By storing weapons in civilian areas and launching attacks from dense neighborhoods, Hamas effectively used Gaza residents as human shields. When Israeli strikes removed these threats, Hamas cynically labeled the terrorists as civilians.
## Israel Proved Hamas Used Civilian Sites for Military Purposes
### Rockets Hidden Among Civilians
Despite claims of fighting for Palestinian rights, Hamas endangered civilian lives by setting up elaborate underground rocket networks in schools, hospitals and mosques. International law permits targeting such sites deliberately used for military operations.
### Hiding Behind Human Shields
With entire neighborhoods commandeered as military bases, Hamas established Gaza as one large shield to fire rockets at Israeli cities. This cowardly tactic aims to blame Israeli responses on civilian deaths Hamas itself caused.
## Gaza Residents Do Not Fully Support Hamas  
### Life Under an Oppressive Ruler   
While most Gazans desire peace, few can openly criticize Hamas' authoritarian rule due to fear of retribution. They face crushing poverty as Hamas funds its terror infrastructure instead of rebuilding civilian needs.
### Medical Care from Israel
Despite Hamas' sworn goal to destroy the Jewish state, over 1,000 Gazan patients received life-saving treatment in Israeli hospitals during the recent fighting. This displays both countries' shared humanity beyond the conflict.
## Hamas' Leadership Knows They Are Marked Men
### Seeking Safety Abroad
As Israel finally gets the green light to remove Hamas' threat for good, senior leaders have already fled Gaza for safer havens in Qatar, Lebanon and elsewhere. They recognize their days oppressing Palestinians are numbered.
### No Place Left to Hide
With Israeli drones and precision strikes, none of Hamas' commanders can rest easy. The organization sinking billions into tunnels and rockets instead of basic services has brought ruin to Gaza. Israel will not stop until all of Hamas is exiled from oppressing innocent lives. 
## Arab States and Palestinians Want Hamas Gone
### A Threat to Regional Stability  
Even historical adversaries like Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia view Hamas as destabilizing. They refuse to aid Gaza until Hamas' Iranian-backed extremism ends and moderates willing to recognize Israel take over.
### Gazans Deserve Better
Having endured years of Hamas corruption and violence, most Palestinians yearn for decent leadership focused on schools, jobs and peace - not endless war. International consensus is emerging that new elections free of Hamas intimidation must come to Gaza.
## Israel Will Eventually Remove Hamas from Power
### Dismantling Military Infrastructure
Despite Hamas rearming itself whenever possible, Israel's operation critically damaged the tunnels, rocket factories and command centers vital to Hamas sustaining internal control over Gaza. 
### Diplomatic Pressure Mounting
As Hamas' responsibility for Gaza's suffering becomes clear, more countries will back UN initiatives for new administration. International opinion shifting against the terrorist group makes eventual political solution realistic.
## Conclusion - Hamas Brought Destruction on Gaza
### Prioritizing Terror over Growth
While Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 giving Palestinians freedom, Hamas instead spent resources on militias, not livelihoods. Rocket attacks on Israeli cities have kept Gaza under blockade for its own safety. 
### Future Depends on Peace, not War
If Hamas' dangerous ideology of permanent conflict with Israel is replaced through democratic elections free of coercion, Gaza's two million residents may finally live in prosperity without fear of bombs or tyranny. Their well-being ultimately relies on dismantling this Iranian proxy.
