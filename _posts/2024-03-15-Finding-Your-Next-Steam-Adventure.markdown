## ### Free to Play Games
Warframe and Air Brawl are excellent free-to-play options on Steam's massive library. Warframe is a third person sci-fi shooter where you take on the role of a space ninja with guns, embarking on missions with fully voiced cutscenes. Players can join factions, customize their characters, and take part in raids together. Another free option is Air Brawl, an online dogfighting game where pilots mini planes in various game modes and maps against other players or AI opponents. Both games have huge active player bases and no single way to win, allowing gamers to play however they choose without pressure to spend money. Their free nature means there's no risk in downloading to check them out.
