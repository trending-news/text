### Guiding Principles in Islam
Islam encourages avoiding harm and promoting goodness. While entertainment has its place, time should primarily be spent on fulfilling religious obligations and beneficial activities. Content consumed should align with Islamic values and not include violence, obscenity, or actions that damage faith.

### Issues with Mainstream Games
Many popular games depict gratuitous violence or normalize criminal behavior. Theft, drug use, sexuality, gambling, and fantastical elements frequently feature. This can desensitize players and promote acceptance of behaviors forbidden in Islam. 
### Effects of Excessive Gaming 
Spending excessive time gaming can detract from important obligations like daily prayers and quality family time. Highly distressing or anxiety-provoking content may negatively impact mental wellbeing. Games designed to be addictive can easily become a priority over real-world responsibilities when not moderated.
### Individual Factors in Permissibility
Appropriateness depends on content, themes, a person's maturity and faith. Time spent must be balanced against other priorities like work, education, charity. One's sensitivity regarding disturbing content is also a factor. What is harmless leisure for some could negatively influence others.  
### Objections to Mainstream Games
Many promote loyalty to non-Islamic nations or cultures over Islamic heritage. Game mechanics may condition dishonest behaviors like cheating to overcome challenges. Depictions that disrespect Islamic figures or beliefs should be avoided.
### Supporting the Gaming Industry  
Selling merchandise from games promoting un-Islamic values faces religious issues. Developers enabling inappropriate content through direct financial support could amount to endorsing related themes. However, faith-neutral or value-focused games may not cause the same concerns.
### Alternative Options in Gaming
Options like educational games, puzzles and nonviolent creative games are preferable alternatives. Faith-based games exploring Islamic concepts productively fill leisure time. Moderate gaming of non-objectionable content can still have a place when balanced with other priorities. 
### Individual Discernment is Key
Each person should use informed discretion guided by religious expertise on complex issues. Focusing on moderation and avoiding clear harms should take priority over total prohibition. Balance with faith, family, health and more important duties is needed.
### Conclusion - Proceed with Caution
Mainstream gaming presents significant religious concerns due to normalization of forbidden behaviors. Direct or indirect financial support could amount to endorsing related content. Individual accountability and caution are important to avoid potential harms while still allowing for benign leisure within reasonable limits. Moderation in all things is key.
