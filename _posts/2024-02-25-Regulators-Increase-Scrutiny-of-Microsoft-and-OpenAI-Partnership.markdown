### Background of Microsoft and OpenAI partnership  
Microsoft has been a major backer of OpenAI since 2019, investing over $1 billion in the San Francisco based nonprofit AI safety lab. The partnership grants Microsoft nonexclusive access to OpenAI's AI technologies and allows them to collaborate on new applications. However, some see the close ties raising antitrust concerns about potential control over next generation AI innovations. With Microsoft's financial might and global cloud computing infrastructure, the partnership could give them outsized influence in the emerging AI industry.

### Ongoing regulatory inquiries
In 2020, the United States Department of Justice opened a preliminary antitrust investigation into the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership. The probe seeks to understand how the deal may impact competition and determine if any limitations are needed. While the inquiry remains ongoing after over two years, regulators are said to be closely evaluating concerns the partnership could concentrate too much power. Across the Atlantic, the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority also launched its own review in 2021 to assess the governance changes and their ramifications for fair competition in the region. 
### Potential impacts on partnership from scrutiny
With heightened regulatory oversight, there is increased uncertainty around the future of the partnership. One possibility is that investigations ultimately require structural changes be made to address monopoly concerns. Microsoft may have to divest some control or influence over OpenAI to gain approval. Delays or restrictions from probes also introduce new compliance complexities. Both companies also face reputational risks if seen as stifling competition or innovation through their close relationship. Overall, heightened regulatory attention introduces significant challenges that could complicate or even block future cooperation.
### UK Competition and Markets Authority inquiry
As part of its investigation, the CMA sought feedback on governance changes Microsoft and OpenAI implemented in 2021 that gave the tech giant even greater access. They are assessing whether the modifications result in a relevant merger situation under UK laws. If so, a formal in-depth Phase 2 investigation may be triggered. This would subject the partnership to closer legal scrutiny regarding its impacts on competition for AI technologies and cloud services within the UK market. The CMA's probe remains in preliminary stages but adds to the regulatory pressures facing the partnership on both sides of the Atlantic.
### Inquiries remain in preliminary stages
Both the Department of Justice and Competition and Markets Authority investigations are still in their initial fact finding phases. A final determination on whether the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership violates any antitrust laws has yet to be made. Regulators may expand the scope of their reviews or alter focus as new information emerges. They also retain the option to take enforcement actions like issuing requirements for structural changes. This uncertainty means significant risks remain for the companies as they seek to navigate heightened oversight from governments and competition authorities worldwide.
### Implications for future of partnership
With regulatory clouds looming, Microsoft and OpenAI face difficulties accurately planning their joint work going forward. Strict compliance requirements or constraints on the partnership could undermine potential benefits. For projects that require massive investments and long timelines, not knowing the ultimate fate of cooperation increases business risks substantially. Any limitations or restrictions also set precedents for future partnerships at the intersection of technology and monopoly concerns. Overall, navigating the scrutiny places the future viability of the Microsoft-OpenAI alliance in doubt.
### Heightened attention on regulating advanced technologies 
As innovations like artificial intelligence transform economies and societies at an unprecedented pace, governments are more proactively overseeing their development and impacts. Beyond just antitrust issues, AI raises novel challenges around privacy, bias, transparency, and societal effects that existing laws and frameworks often do not fully address. This has put technology partnerships under the microscope while authorities seek to ensure public interests are safeguarded. With rapid changes also come regulatory growing pains as rules continue evolving to catch up to new technical realities. 
### Microsoft and OpenAI navigating regulatory risks
Faced with growing regulatory oversight, Microsoft and OpenAI find themselves in increasingly complex terrain. To demonstrate compliance, both organizations are fully cooperating with antitrust and competition authority inquiries on both sides of the Atlantic. This may involve providing internal documents, communications and making staff available for interviews. Even with cooperation though, structural changes or constraints on the partnership also remain possibilities regulators may ultimately require. Microsoft and OpenAI must carefully balance continued innovation with reassuring regulators of open and fair competition in key technology markets like cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Finding the right path forward will be crucial to sustaining their ambitions in these emerging fields.
### Conclusion
Greater governmental scrutiny of the relationship between technology leaders and how their actions may impact monopolies or competition has significant implications for partnerships at the nexus of innovation like Microsoft and OpenAI's. While regulatory uncertainties introduce challenges, ensuring the interests of consumers and society are protected as new technologies develop will remain key priorities for authorities worldwide. How Microsoft and OpenAI navigate this period of assessment could set precedents for the wider industry and help determine what sustained cooperation may look like under evolving regulatory norms focused on issues like antitrust, privacy and fair competition in AI.
