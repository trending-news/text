The PlayStation 4 has outsold the Xbox One by a wide margin since both systems launched in late 2013. As of early 2017, PS4 global sales have surpassed 40 million units worldwide while Xbox One trails at around 21 million units sold globally. This early and continued hardware sales lead has helped PlayStation maintain market dominance in the home console space. However, Microsoft is improving its position with console refreshes like the Xbox One S and the upcoming Project Scorpio promises more power that could potentially change purchase decisions for some gamers.
### Exclusive Franchises and Developer Relationships
When it comes to exclusive games and the relationships with developers, PlayStation has a long history with Japanese studios that have resulted in some beloved franchises only appearing on its consoles. Final Fantasy, Persona, Monster Hunter, and long-running series like Gran Turismo are just a few examples of mega popular Japan-developer games only available on PlayStation. Sony also invests in top Western developers to bring hits like Uncharted and Horizon Zero Dawn exclusively to PS4. Meanwhile, Xbox focuses on building out its library with Halo, Gears of War, and Forza while courting developers to boost its lineup.

### Backwards Compatibility and Legacy Game Support 
Backwards compatibility is an important feature for those who want to continue playing games from previous console generations on new hardware. While neither system offers a perfect replacement for older consoles yet, Xbox One leads here by allowing over 100 Xbox 360 games to be played through emulation. PlayStation 4 lacks backwards compatibility for PS3 discs, but the PlayStation Now game streaming service offers access to a library of PS3 games for a monthly subscription fee. However, input lag and occasional streaming issues diminish the experience compared to playing physically on original hardware. 
### Hardware Specs, Refreshes, and the Road Ahead
In terms of raw performance, the standard PS4 and Xbox One are comparable hardware-wise though PlayStation added a higher-end 4K capable PS4 Pro model in late 2016. Meanwhile, Microsoft answered with a cheaper updated Xbox One S that supports 4K video and Ultra HD Blu-ray playback without performance enhancements. Looking ahead, Project Scorpio promises to be the most powerful console ever made when it launches this holiday season with full support for true 4K gaming. How these iterative hardware refreshes impact purchase decisions remains to be seen, but 4K capabilities are enticing many consumers.
### Controller Design, Ergonomics, and Extra Features  
Controllers are an important part of the overall experience, and both PlayStation and Xbox have continued refining their designs. The DualShock 4 added improved thumbsticks, triggers, and a touchpad over the PlayStation predecessors but still strangely lacks a headphone jack. Xbox One controllers built upon the acclaimed ergonomics of the Xbox 360 pad with slight improvements like impulse triggers and connectivity. An advantage PlayStation has is the DualShock working natively on Windows PCs, though extra software is required, while Xbox controllers just plug and play. 
### Media Features, Multimedia Support, and Beyond Gaming
Both consoles aim to be all-in-one entertainment hubs, not just for games. Initially, the Xbox One led here by including a Blu-ray player and deeper media app integration out of the box. However, Sony caught up by adding video streaming apps and 4K Blu-ray playback capacity to the PS4 Pro and Slim models. Still, PS4 multimedia support lacks features like DLNA server streaming promised in future updates while Xbox continues expanding codec/file format support for local media. As media hubs, value depends on preferred apps and existing device ecosystems.
### PlayStation VR and the Dawn of Virtual Reality Gaming
When it comes to truly next-gen technologies, PlayStation emerged as the first console maker to fully support virtual reality gaming. PlayStation VR launched in late 2016 to generally positive reviews, showcasing the potential of immersive new experiences on home consoles. Dozens of PSVR games launched in its first year ranging from experiences to full campaigns. While VR requires extra hardware investment and some games induce motion sickness, popular titles driving PSVR hardware and software sales could convince undecided buyers to choose a PlayStation over competing options. How and if Microsoft plans to compete in this new space remains unseen for now.  
### Online Communities, Multiplayer, and the Split-Screen Problem 
One drawback of purchasing one system over another is the risk of losing the ability to regularly play online with friends who choose a different platform. Console-exclusive multiplayer titles can potentially fragment gaming groups, leaving some looking for cross-play functionality that unfortunately many developers still do not support between PlayStation and Xbox Live. Split-screen local multiplayer, a hallmark of past generations, also appears in decline as developers focus on online modes instead – another consideration for gamers wanting to regularly play together in person. Enabling cross-console communities remains a continued request from fans of both platforms.
### Competition is Good and the Evolution Marches On
Overall, both PlayStation and Xbox continuously work to one-up each other with new features, hardware, and exclusive games based on feedback. This results in steady innovation and value for dedicated fans on both “sides.” However, the landscape remains in flux as virtual and augmented reality, streaming games, and new business models transform how people play. In this dynamic market, no single company holds a permanent advantage for long as technology and tastes evolve rapidly. Gamers always stand to benefit most from the competitive pressures that push Sony and Microsoft to enter an arms race of sorts, keeping each other on their toes for the foreseeable future.
