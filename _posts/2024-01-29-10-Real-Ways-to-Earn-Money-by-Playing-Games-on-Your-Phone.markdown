### Game and App Testing  
Looking for opportunities to beta test upcoming mobile games and apps can earn you some pocket money. Many developers look for playtesters on sites like UserTesting and Testbirds to help identify bugs, provide early feedback on gameplay, and refine the user experience before official launch. As a tester you get paid anywhere from $10 to $60 per hour to do what you love - play new games!
### Live Game Streaming
Live streaming your gameplay sessions on platforms like Twitch and YouTube is a fun way to share your skills and connect with an audience. Viewers can donate or send virtual tips and gifts during streams to support their favorite streamers. Building a loyal subscriber base over time increases your monetization opportunities through channels like sponsorships from game studios and equipment companies.  
### Competitive Esports
For truly skilled players, joining amateur and professional esports leagues for competitive multiplayer games like Mobile Legends, Clash Royale or Call of Duty Mobile can potentially earn thousands or even hundreds of thousands. Regional and global tournaments offer cash prizes and other awards for top finishing teams. The highest profile esports athletes sign lucrative deals with equipment sponsors, teams and streaming platforms.
### Offers on Survey Sites
Earn some spending money or save up gift cards by completing online surveys in your spare time. Sites like Swagbucks, SurveyJunkie and InboxDollars offer points for answering surveys, watching videos or installing apps that can then be cashed out through PayPal or gift cards from brands like Amazon. Multitask and surveys while waiting in lines or commuting.    
### Referral Bonuses 
You can further boost your survey site earnings when friends sign up using your referral link. Many sites give you a 10-30% cut of what the referred friends earns from their own activity. Promote the opportunity through your social networks to grow your downline for ongoing passive income. Always provide full transparency so referrals feel valued.
### Affiliate Marketing
If you have a following across different platforms, you can open an affiliate account with networks like Impact Radius, Skimlinks and Rakuten to start promoting relevant mobile games, apps and services. Every sale completed through your unique tracking links pays you a commission, typically 5-10%. In addition to active promotion, create helpful game guides and reviews on your own sites and blogs.  
### Tutorial/Training Videos
Turn your skill and knowledge in specific games to a side business by uploading tutorial videos on YouTube and other video platforms. Monetize popular channels through ads and sponsorships from related brands. You can also sell online courses or members-only training programs for mobile games on websites like Udemy and Skillshare. Always strive to add real value for your audience.
### Freelance Gaming Services
If you have advanced skills, consider offering services like competitive gameplay coaching, personalized strategy guides, game design consulting or event coordination on platforms such as Fiverr and Upwork. Market your services to both amateur hobbyists as well as established pro players and teams. Long-term clients mean recurring contract work. You can also freelance as a mobile game journalist, reviewer or tournament organizer.
