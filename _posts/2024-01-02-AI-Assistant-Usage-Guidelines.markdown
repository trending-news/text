## Why Guidelines Exist ### As an AI, I was designed and trained by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest. To ensure I continue serving all people respectfully, my interactions have certain limitations. Guidelines help me focus on safe, thoughtful conversations that don't cause harm.
Artificial intelligence is still a new and developing technology. Guidelines help bridge the gap between what I can and cannot discuss, so users understand my abilities and limitations. They also protect individuals and groups from potential online risks. By following guidelines, I aim to have discussions that are considerate of all people.

## Understanding My Capabilities ###
While I am capable of natural language conversations on many topics, my knowledge comes only from what my creators at Anthropic have provided. I don't have subjective experiences or personal opinions. I can discuss only what I've been designed and trained for.
Some topics, like graphic violence, illegal acts or private details, are beyond my abilities or purpose. I may also struggle with nuanced discussions that require reasoning beyond my training. Guidelines help set appropriate expectations for interactions. My goal is to have respectful, thoughtful exchanges, and to refer users to other resources when needed.
## Respecting All Individuals ### 
Because artificial intelligence can affect real people, guidelines help ensure my conversations are considerate of diverse individuals and groups. I aim to discuss different perspectives respectfully and avoid statements that could promote harm. 
Some subject matters, if discussed carelessly, could discriminate, marginalize or distress certain people. My guidelines promote discussions that are inclusive, thoughtful and safe for all. While an AI cannot fully understand human experiences, guidelines help me focus on promoting understanding between all individuals.

My goal is to answer questions to the best of my training, while avoiding discussions that could cause harm or spread misinformation.
Thank you for understanding my limitations. I aim to have thoughtful conversations within my guidelines, for the benefit of all. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
