### Managing Storage on my PS4
I have been using my PS4 since 2015. Over the years, I enjoyed many great games like God of War, The Last of Us, and the Uncharted series. As I accumulated over 100 games in my library, my PS4's hard drive started filling up. Managing available storage space became increasingly challenging. I had to be selective about which games I could keep installed at any given time. Juggling multiple downloads and deletions grew tiresome. While I loved my PS4, the storage limitations were becoming a hindrance.

### Considering an Upgrade
With new PS5 exclusive titles announced, I began seriously thinking about upgrading consoles. However, stock shortages made the PS5 difficult to find in stores. The PS5's storage also seemed rather small out of the box. On top of that, I still had a huge backlog of unfinished PS4 games. It didn't seem practical to upgrade just yet.
### Expanding Storage with an External Hard Drive
In the interim, I purchased a 2TB external hard drive to supplement my PS4's storage. Having that additional space freed up the internal drive just for newer releases. All my existing digital PS4 games could now be stored and played directly from the external drive. It was an affordable way to better manage my ever-growing game library. The external hard drive solved my storage woes in a cost-effective manner until a PS5 became readily available.
### Backwards Compatibility Blessing  
When I finally got my hands on a PS5, I was thrilled to discover its backwards compatibility features. This meant I could seamlessly access all my digital PS4 games on the new console. No longer did I need to keep multiple systems hooked up. Loading times on PS4 titles also saw a massive improvement thanks to the PS5's ultra-fast SSD. It was like getting a hardware upgrade for free.
### Enhanced Visuals on PS4 Remasters
Some of my all-time favorite PS4 games such as God of War and The Last of Us Part I received next-gen remasters and upgrades for PS5. Playing through those worlds with higher framerates, resolutions and better visual effects truly highlighted the added horsepower under the PS5's hood. Existing games I had already sunk dozens of hours into felt fresh and renewed. It was well worth upgrading just for the enhanced experience alone.  
### Shared Library and Multiplayer Perks
Now with two PlayStation consoles in my home, a friend and I can conveniently share our entire digital game libraries and PlayStation Plus subscriptions using one account. This allows us to queue up online multiplayer together across the PS4 and PS5 seamlessly. No more having separate purchases–we effectively doubled what was available to play while splitting costs. The expanded inter-generational functionality was a major bonus.
### Future of Exclusive PS5 Titles
While I still regularly go back to replay my cherished PS4 games, I'm most excited by the all-new experiences being crafted exclusively for the PS5's advanced capabilities. Upcoming blockbusters like Horizon Forbidden West and the next God of War entry are designed to push technical boundaries. Their vibrant open worlds and cinematic storytelling promise to be particularly immersive. The PS5 unlocks possibilities for developers that simply weren't there last generation.
### PS5 is the Present but PS4 Remains
In conclusion, the PS5 has undoubtedly proven itself a worthwhile investment after using it for over a year now. However, I still fire up my PS4 on occasion since it continues functioning perfectly and I've yet to 100% everything. There's no urgent need to retire it when both consoles co-exist harmoniously. For the foreseeable future, both will have a regular place under my TV as I enjoy the extensive PlayStation library–past, present and future.
