### Why games need updates
Games are living pieces of software that continue evolving after their initial release. Developers monitor player feedback and usage data to identify issues that need addressing. Day one patches are frequently deployed to fix critical bugs and polish the gameplay experience based on early access. Maintaining and improving games is an ongoing process that benefits greatly from being connected online.

### Checking for and downloading game updates
The Xbox makes keeping games up-to-date simple. From the "My games & apps" menu, select "Updates" to view available patches. The console will automatically check for new updates in the background. When an update is ready, you'll receive a notification. For large downloads, the Xbox allows continuing to play other games while installing in the background. This helps minimize downtime from needed updates.
### The importance of game updates 
Beyond bug fixes, updates are how developers enhance and balance different elements of a game based on community feedback. They refine the gameplay and tweak features over time. For online multiplayer to function properly, everyone needs to be on the same page version-wise. Day one updates especially aim to smooth out any rough edges players may encounter from launch. Keeping games current ensures the best experience.
### Single player vs multiplayer games
While some single-player titles can be played without the most recent update, there may be lingering issues. Future add-ons also typically require being fully patched. Multiplayer modes absolutely demand all players match the current build. Missing updates means not being able to join friends or access all game modes. For the fullest access to content and smoothest operation, keeping both types updated is recommended.
### Benefits of keeping games updated
Games as a service is now the norm, with new modes and extras streamed out long after launch. Future downloadable content may list specific updates as prerequisites. Developers are constantly identifying and solving bugs, so having the latest patch prevents frustrating glitches. Over time, balance adjustments are made to weapons, abilities, and other systems. Being on the most updated version ensures experiencing a game as the designers now intend it.
### Installing vs playing from disc
Xbox titles are installed to the console's hard drive for much quicker loading versus reading directly from disc. But the disc still acts as the license required for playing a purchased game. When a game is installed, the system can download any needed updates in the background whether the console is on or in power-saving mode. This lets updates complete without extra wait time before playing.
### Playing without installing updates
Missing updates won't necessarily prevent launching a game entirely. But certain features may be blocked without the latest version. Hints will be provided on what won't work until updating. Although some less connected single-player games could still be enjoyed patch-free, it's always best to take the few minutes and install updates for fuller access to all parts of the experience developers intend.
### What triggers the update check  
Starting up certain games is what initiates the Xbox checking online for any available updates to that title. Simply returning to the home screen after a session can also provide the opportunity for the console to scan for anything new. Games will automatically install updates painlessly when the system is configured for instant-on updating in rest mode.
### Contacting support for slow or failed updates
At times, slow download speeds or errors could indicate an issue preventing smooth updates. Xbox support representatives are available to help diagnose potential problems if updates fail or take an unusually long time. Common issues might involve your internet connection or the console hardware itself. Making sure the system is configured for instant-on ensures timely updates when issues do arise that require troubleshooting assistance.
