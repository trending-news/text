### Options for Offline Console Gaming
Offline gaming consoles like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch offer a wide variety of single player games without needing an internet connection. These consoles have robust libraries filled with adventures that can be enjoyed whether you're connected or not. Handheld options like the PSP and Nintendo 3DS also allow offline play on the go. Retro consoles let you enjoy gaming classics from decades past without any WiFi dependency.

### Genres of Offline Games  
Some of the most popular offline game genres include action-adventure titles, role-playing games, puzzle games, and sports games. For example, long-running franchises from Super Mario to The Legend of Zelda to Sonic the Hedgehog have entertained generations with fully-featured single player experiences. These genres are perfectly suited for solo gameplay without an internet connection.
### Connection Requirements of Some Games
While many single player games are fully offline-enabled right out of the box, some titles do require an internet connection. This is usually due to things like digital rights management (DRM), optional online features, automatic patches and updates, anti-cheating measures, data collection, or certain licensing and activation processes. Developers make different choices based on their specific goals and envisioned player experience for each game.
### The Significance of Latency for Online Games
In contrast, massively multiplayer online (MMO) games demand extremely low latency for realistic and enjoyable gameplay across a worldwide player base. Research has shown that network delays over 100 milliseconds can negatively impact player performance, with 50ms or less considered ideal. MMOs push online infrastructure to handle thousands of simultaneous players from around the globe at competitive speeds.
### Playing Steam Games Offline
While best known as a digital PC games marketplace, Steam also allows offline gameplay. Simply launch Steam in offline mode to access your library's games that don't require a constant internet connection for their single player portions. You won't be able to download any new updates until going back online, but it enables fun and functional offline experiences.
### Popular Offline PlayStation Games  
Blockbuster PlayStation exclusives like The Last of Us, God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn and the Uncharted series deliver incredibly compelling single player campaigns that don't actually require a live internet connection. Be sure to double check product pages or labels for any network requirements rather than automatically assuming a connection is essential.
### Modding Offline-Capable Games
While modifying online-focused games to function solely offline could potentially violate licensing agreements or risk account penalties, some offline-oriented games openly embrace modding communities. However, extensive alterations may degrade experiences meticulously designed around integrated online components. It's generally best to play as intended whenever possible for the authentic experience.
### Additional Offline-Friendly Genres
Beyond the standard offline genres, many role-playing games (RPGs) like The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series along with survival, simulation, and open-world/sandbox titles offer robust solo experiences without internet. Minecraft in particular has found immense popularity through fully-functional offline creative and survival gameplay.
### Choosing Games Based on Your Preferences
For the most immersive and enjoyable solo gaming without an internet connection, carefully screening product pages and reviews highlighting network requirements is important. Also consider your preferred genres and playstyles to pick experiences tailored towards appreciating offline capabilities. With diligent research, you'll discover a bounty of excellent options for unplugged gaming.
