### The appeal of structure and freedom in single player games
Single player games allow me to fully immerse myself in the worlds that game developers create without distractions. I can pause the game anytime I want and pick it up later without needing to coordinate schedules with others. The linear narrative structure of many single player games also give me a sense of progression as I work towards completing objectives and advancing the story. At the same time, many single player games provide plenty of freedom for me to explore at my own pace and engage with side quests or optional content.

### Avoiding annoyance from other players in multiplayer games  
Competitive multiplayer games often involve interacting with strangers online which can sometimes lead to annoying encounters. People may rage quit, talk trash in the chat, or attempt to sabotage teammates. The asynchronous nature of many single player games means I don't have to worry about depending on the cooperation or coordination of others. I can play purely for my own enjoyment without dealing with hostility from toxic players.
### Less pressure and more fun without competition in single player
There is less pressure to perform well or keep up intense grinding in single player games compared to multiplayer games with competitive rankings. I can play single player games more casually at my own pace without worry of letting down a team. Experimenting with different builds and playstyles is also more welcoming in single player where mistakes donâ€™t negatively impact others. The cooperative and non-competitive nature of single player gaming creates a lower stress environment where I can simply have fun exploring worlds and stories.
### Story and character focused single player games
Some of the most memorable gaming experiences I've had are from deeply engaging single player narratives and the relationships I form with unique characters. Developers are able to craft intricate plots and fully realize rich fictional universes without limitations of online coordination or balancing for competitive multiplayer. Games like The Last of Us, Red Dead Redemption 2, and God of War have moved me with their sophisticated storytelling in a way that very few multiplayer games have achieved. The focus on characterization and cinematic presentation in many acclaimed single player titles is truly unmatched.
### Exceptions - enjoying multiplayer in specific games
While I generally prefer single player experiences, there are some multiplayer games that I truly enjoy playing with friends such as co-op titles like Borderlands and Left 4 Dead. Competing cooperatively against AI enemies and bosses provides memorable moments without the downsides of competitive PvP. I also appreciate games with a strong social component like Fortnite where interacting with friends is emphasized over serious rankings. In the right multiplayer settings and with people I know, teaming up can be very fun.
### Unfair advantages from pausing online games
One advantage that single player afford is the ability to pause the game whenever needed. This allows me to step away for a moment without jeopardizing my progress or giving other players an unfair advantage like they could get in an online match. Things happen in real life that may require stopping a game temporarily and single playermode accommodates this seamlessly. It's frustrating in competitive multiplayer when pause functionality isn't available and life gets in the way of finishing a match.
### Waiting for complete, polished game experiences
It's not uncommon for multiplayer focused games to be regularly updated and altered even after release through patches, DLC additions, and seasonal content drops. While this ongoing support keeps the community engaged, it also means the player experience is never truly finished and faces constant changes. I prefer the complete and stable experiences provided by many single player games on launch. Developers have more time to thoroughly polish and refine all aspects of the product without needing to also balance ongoing multiplayer elements.
### Lack of motivation from competitive multiplayer games
Staying interested and motivated long-term in competitive multiplayer titles requires either a tremendous competitive drive or continual grinding of ranking systems. Personally, I find the extrinsic motivation of rankings and leaderboards wears off for me over time. Single player games place more emphasis on the joy of exploration, discovery, and narrative accomplishment which fuels my engagement intrinsically. Once I've cleared all the story and side content, I feel satisfied moving on rather than compelled to continually play.
### Finishing games vs long term commitment of multiplayer
With single player titles, I have a clear sense of progression as I work towards completing objectives, leveling up characters, and eventually finishing the full experience. There is a resolve to see the story through to the end. Many multiplayer games lack a true conclusion and transforming into commitments I play periodically for years. I prefer having a definitive ending to celebrate rather than games that simply continue perpetually. Single player games provide me the satisfaction of finishing what I start.
