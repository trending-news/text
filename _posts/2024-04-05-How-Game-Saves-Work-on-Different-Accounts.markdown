Game saves are stored separately for each Xbox account. Progress made in a game is not shared between accounts. Achievements and game history are unique to each individual account.
### Sharing Saves Through Cloud Storage  
Many games store save data in the cloud when connected to Xbox Live. This allows saves to be accessed from any device linked to the same account. Players can pick up where they left off between Xbox consoles or Windows PCs. Some older games only save locally without cloud backup.

### Saving Data When Uninstalling Games
Game saves exist independently from game files even after a game is uninstalled. Saves will remain on the hard drive and automatically upload to the cloud for Online Storage. Saves can also be manually copied to external storage as a backup.
### Accessing Saves on Multiple Consoles
Saves sync through the cloud when signing into an Xbox Live account on any console. No matter which Xbox is used, a player's progress will be continued from their most recent save. However, saves are only accessible with the individual account they are associated with.
### Game Sharing Between Accounts   
Accounts must designate each other's consoles as their "home console" to share digital games. When playing shared titles, only one account can access the content across devices at a time. But each account's unique save data remains separate based on their individual progress in each game.
### Leaving Games with Gold and Xbox Game Pass
If a game is removed from an Xbox subscription service, any existing saves will be kept. Players can redownload past games and resume playing with their saved progress. However, new users would need to purchase games no longer included in the program to access them.
### Using One Account on Multiple Consoles Simultaneously
The same Xbox Live account cannot access shared content like games or subscriptions across multiple devices at the same time. This can cause conflicts over achievements, multiplayer access, and synchronized save data being used on separate consoles concurrently. 
### Parental Controls and Content Locks
Console parental controls allow restricting access to entire accounts, specific games, or disabling cloud saves and syncing. This gives parents oversight of what games - and saved progress within games - young players can access based on content ratings and time limits.
### Summary of Key Points About Game Saves Across Accounts
In summary, each Xbox account stores unique save data for played games. Progress is not shared between accounts but can sync across devices through cloud storage when signed into the account. Saves remain even when games are uninstalled and can be backed up. Multiple consoles can access the same saves, but only one at a time to avoid conflicts. Game sharing and subscriptions require planning around save syncing between devices and accounts. Parental controls provide configuration options for family access and restrictions.
