There is an ongoing debate in the gaming community about which platform is easier for gaming - PC or console. Both have their pros and cons when it comes to factors like setup, costs, controls and flexibility. Let's take a deeper look at how they compare.
### Hardware and Setup
Setting up a console like the PlayStation or Xbox is quite simple - you just plug it in and you're ready to play. With a PC, building or buying a gaming rig requires more work. You need to pick compatible components, install them properly and install windows. Maintaining upgrades also needs technical know-how. However, PCs allow upgrading specific parts like the GPU for improved performance down the line.

### Game Library and Costs  
Console games generally have a standard $60 price tag while Steam and other PC stores regularly discount titles, saving money in the long run. Consoles ensure games work straight out of the box on their hardware too. But PC games take advantage of superior horsepower and customization with mods.
### Controls and Interface
Gamepads offer a relaxing couch experience that works well for many genres. But mouse and keyboard provide more precision that benefits strategy, simulation and competitive online shooters. The PC interface is also highly customizable through options, mods and tool tweaks.
### Online Experience
Console online multiplayer requires a paid subscription service, unlike free online for PC players. However, the PC player base tends to be more hardcore which can pose a steeper learning curve for new and casual players. Matchmaking and servers also vary between platforms. 
### Flexibility and Longevity
PCs have a level of customization and upgradability that extends their useful lifetime far beyond a console's. From high refresh rate monitors to steering wheels and flight sticks, PCs support diverse inputs. Meanwhile, consoles deliver a consistent experience for 6-8 years until the next generation arrives.
### Ease of Use
Plug-and-play is simplest on consoles without any configuration hassles. However, experienced PC builders can optimize performance to rival or outdo consoles with the right tweaks. Finding technical help is also easier through console company support teams. Overall it depends on a gamer's technical comfort level and flexibility needs.
In conclusion, both PC and console gaming have their merits depending on player's priorities around costs, control preferences, technical skills and desires for upgrades or modding. With some know-how either can provide an easy gaming experience suited to different kinds of gamers. It comes down to weighing these factors based on individual needs and play styles.
