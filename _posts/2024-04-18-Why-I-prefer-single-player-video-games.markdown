### I want to play at my own pace without waiting for others or being waited on
Single-player games allow me complete control over how and when I play. There is no need to wait around for other people or feel rushed if they're impatient. I can take as many breaks as I need without worrying about abandoning teammates mid-match. The pacing is entirely up to me based on my mood, schedule, and life responsibilities. This flexibility is important for someone with a busy lifestyle like myself.

### I don't have to deal with unpleasant or toxic other players
While many multiplayer games have wonderful communities, there is always a chance of encountering rude, insulting, or problematic players. This can seriously detract from the enjoyment of a gaming session. In single-player, I don't have to experience verbal abuse, trolling, raging, cheating or any other unpleasantness that sometimes occurs when interacting with strangers online. The gameplay remains a positive escape without these social tradeoffs.
### I can play whenever I want without coordinating with others
Organizing group playtimes with friends can be challenging even for people with open schedules. Between work, family duties, sleep and other commitments, it's not always easy for everyone to hop online simultaneously. This can lead to canceled plans or cut-short sessions. As a solo player, none of this is an issue. I am completely free to jump into a game for as long or short as I choose without relying on others' availability. Spontaneity and solitude are very appealing aspects.
### Single-player games allow more freedom to do whatever I want without compromising
When playing alone, there are no teammates counting on me to fulfill a specific role or follow strategies. I can explore every nook and cranny of the game world freely without worrying if others are getting bored waiting around. I face no pressure to perform well or win against human opponents. Failure has no cost beyond my own time invested. This freedom from obligations to others enhances relaxation for me.
### I enjoy finishing games and can do this at my own pace with single-player
Completing every mission, side quest and challenge a game offers is very satisfying, but in multiplayer this can be a challenge if others want to rush through or move on before I'm ready. In solo games, pacing and 100% completion is entirely up to me. There are no time limits imposed by friends or matchmaking systems either. I find taking my time with games more rewarding than speeding through.
### Many single-player games have good replay value, allowing unlimited game time for the initial cost
With great stories and mechanics, many single-player titles incentivize revisiting long after finishing the main plot. It's common to find new tidbits and subtle foreshadowing upon replaying. Multiplayer games lose their community over time, but single-player games remain fully playable regardless. This ensures a continued return on the initial purchase price for years to come through multiple playthroughs and challenge runs.
### I enjoy fully immersing in rich storytelling and character development
Games that put narrative first, focusing on memorable characters and emotional arcs really appeal to me. Multiplayer often sees story minimized to focus on constant PvP or levelling loops. Solo titles let me step fully into another world and care deeply about its inhabitants without distractions. Games like The Last of Us, God of War and Red Dead Redemption left powerful impressions through brilliant storytelling only possible without other players involved.
### They allow for more in-depth exploration of richly crafted game worlds without distractions
When playing alone, I can freely stop to absorb every beautiful backdrop, read every note and document, and examine every small detail that went into developing the virtual setting. In multiplayer, others often want to rush ahead or stick to core objectives. Solo play lets me luxuriate in the little things and notice subtle environmental storytelling most might miss. Fully exploring every inch of beautifully realized locations is a joy.
### I'm not competitive so multiplayer games focused on becoming best aren't appealing
While competition can be enjoyable for some, it creates anxiety and stress for me personally. I don't find the prospect of endlessly improving my skills just to maintain a rank or K/D ratio appealing long term. Some multiplayer games even shame poor performers openly. The intense pressure turns me away. In solo games, there is no humiliation if I fail or die often against clever AI. I prefer a stress-free experience focused on fun over eSports-level competition.
### I don't want to feel bad if I'm not as skilled as other players or get beaten frequently online
Hand-eye coordination and twitch reflexes and never been strong suits of mine. Jumping into competitive multiplayer games against high-skilled opponents often ends in frustrating defeats for me. This isn't an enjoyable way to spend leisure time. In single-player, I encounter AI skill level appropriate for me to have fun and make progress rather than constantly feel inferior against gods-tier human foes. My pride isn't on the line either. Losing has no emotional impact alone versus other players.
### I want games that make me feel something compelling rather than become numb playing endlessly
While certain multiplayer formats encourage endless play sessions for their own sake, I find this lifestyle dull and numbing after a while. Seeing others as mere combat stats removes emotional depth. However, story-driven solo titles can induce genuine feelings of awe, sorrow, joy, or triumph through their characters and plots. Games that make me empathize or reflect are far more creatively fulfilling than routine competitive gameplay loops. The human element shines through well-told narratives.
### I enjoy cooperative online games like MMORPGs that don't rely on competitive gameplay 
Massively multiplayer online role-playing games or MMORPGs allow cooperation and community-building on a grand scale through adventuring and teamwork against computer-controlled enemies. There is no direct competition between players, just a shared goal of exploration, collection and progression. Grouping up for epic boss battles and dungeon delving is very fun and social without the toxicity that can arise from cutthroat PvP environments. The cooperative spirit is uplifting.
### Creative building games like Minecraft are also fun to play with a small group of friends
In sandbox titles focused on user expression rather than combat, group creativity flourishes without limitations. Collaborating on massive structures, contraptions, or works of art fosters new ideas and brings people together. Building worlds allows bonding without pressures of "winning." These games highlight multiplayer's potential for positive social play when competition is removed from the equation.
### But for most genres I strongly prefer rich single-player experiences
While the exceptions noted can provide fun ways to play with others, most game styles remain best suited for solo adventures in my opinion. Storytelling, exploration, and stress-free mastery are central to my enjoyment. I appreciate multiplayer's social aspects but generally find relaxation through private escapism into detailed game worlds. Single player's flexibility, low commitment, and creative care makes the experience highly preferable overall.
