### Monitoring retailer stock  
With high demand and supply chain issues limiting stock of the Xbox Series S, many people are still trying to find the console months after its launch. Following the social media pages and checking stock trackers regularly is one of the best strategies. Retailers receive small restocks sporadically with items selling out quickly online and in stores. It's important to act fast when an alert comes through.

### Checking Best Buy
Best Buy usually only receives a handful of consoles with each restock. Their Instagram and Twitter are good places to look for restock announcements. Returns are accepted within 15 days of purchase as long as the item is unopened and you have the receipt. Exchanges can also be made for a different Xbox Series S within the return period if it is unsealed.  
### Watching Target restocks  
Like other retailers, Target has limited control over when new Xbox Series S stock arrives. They rely on shipments from Microsoft which come in small batches. To have the best chance, check the website and app regularly or sign up for in-stock alerts. Returns must be made with a receipt within 90 days and the item needs to be in its original unopened packaging. 
### Considering Walmart options
Walmart's site allows third party sellers so not every listing will be shipping directly from them. Be sure to read the specific seller information to understand policies like returns and exchanges. Purchases from Walmart itself can be returned or exchanged within 90 days at any store location as long as tags and all packaging materials are still attached to an unopened item.
### Trading in at GameStop
GameStop accepts used game trades as credit towards new purchases through their PowerUp Rewards Pro program. This can lower the cost of a new console or games. However, opened items can only be exchanged within 7 days for the same title and you need a receipt. Full cash refunds are not offered on opened products without a receipt. It's best to sell trade-ins towards new items rather than expecting cash back.
### Monitoring direct online retailers 
When stock is extremely limited at major stores, checking Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo's websites directly may offer the best chance at a purchase. Signing up for email and Twitter alerts through stock tracking sites can also provide a heads up before sites go live with availability updates. The trade off is longer shipping time versus immediate pickup in store.
### Waiting patiently for more inventory  
With components still in short supply and holiday demand subsiding, retailers expect to receive Xbox Series S restocks throughout 2022. Some industry analysts believe stock shortages could continue into next year. Rather than paying inflated prices from scalpers on auction sites, waiting it out costs nothing but time. More availability should gradually come as production catches up to the enthusiastic player base.
### Key differences between Xbox models
For those unsure which version to get, the main differences are the Xbox Series S is designed as a digital-only console at a lower price point without a disc drive. It has less powerful hardware that targets lower resolutions like 1080p or 1440p versus 4K graphics on the more powerful Series X. Gamepass subscriptions work across both and all your digital titles carry forward. Weigh storage needs, display resolution priorities and budget to pick the best option.
### Staying determined to find an Xbox Series S
High anticipation for Microsoft's latest generation brought a rush of players eager to experience new games. While stock shortages created frustration for many, patience and regularly checking retailer updates can help secure an elusive Xbox Series S with time. Sign up for stock alerts across all major stores, both online and locally. As supply normalizes in the coming year, it will become easier to purchase the in demand console at retail cost rather than from scalpers. By persistently monitoring availability, gamers' dedication will pay off with a new Xbox in hand.
