## How SNES Cartridges Saved Your Progress
The SNES relied on battery-backed SRAM chips to save player progress in games during the early 90s. This allowed gamers to pick up where they left off after powering down. SRAM, or static random-access memory, is volatile memory that requires constant power to maintain its contents. Nintendo included a standard watch battery to keep the SRAM powered even when the system was switched off. 
Over time, these batteries would inevitably drain their charge after 5-10 years. Once depleted, all saved game data would be lost. Fortunately, opening the cartridge and replacing the battery with a new CR2032 coin cell restored the saving functionality. However, this process also erased any existing save files due to the volatile nature of SRAM memory. Still, it allowed players to continue experiencing beloved RPGs and other titles that incorporated saving.
## Notable SNES Games with Saving
A handful of SNES classics truly shined thanks to their support for in-game saving. Super Mario World let players explore the massive mushroom kingdom across multiple play sessions. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past featured a similarly sprawling overworld filled with dungeons, secrets and equipment upgrades.  
Role-playing juggernauts like Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger immersed players in epic stories across dozens of hours. The cooperative adventure of Secret of Mana was enhanced by its ability to pick up questing with friends. Another standout was Donkey Kong Country, where saving helped conquer the demanding mine cart and rocket barrel bonus levels. These impactful games allowed the SNES to satisfy both short and long-form gameplay.
## Replacing an Expired SNES Cartridge Battery
As the 1990s turned to the 2000s and beyond, SNES cartridge batteries started giving out left and right. Mostly CR2032 coin cells, their lifespan was typically estimated around 15-20 years depending on usage and storage conditions. To resurrect saving functionality, gamers needed to disassemble cartridge casings using specialized security bits. 
Once opened, a small soldering iron helped remove the dead battery from its terminals. Slightly larger and with more current capacity, modern CR2032 replacements were soldered into the vacant spots. After reassembly and powering on, saving was restored. While requiring some technical skill, thousands of players learned to perform this simple process themselves to preserve their SNES collections and memories.
## Best SNES Games without Saving 
Not every SNES gem relied on battery-backed saving. Seminal titles like Super Metroid, Mega Man X and Yoshi's Island embraced bite-sized, pickup-and-play sessions without fear of lost progress. Their focused, session-based design emphasized constant momentum. 
Games in similar vein included the futuristic racer F-Zero and the run-and-gun action of Contra III: The Alien Wars. Even prolific developer Rare got in on the act with Kirby's Dream Course, a charming take on the miniature golf formula. And for those seeking a more strategic challenge, Kirby's Dream Land 3 and Breath of Fire provided engrossing gameplay without reliance on saving. Battery life was a non-issue for these classics.
## Emulation and Flash Cart Options
As original hardware collected dust on shelves, devoted fans turned to emulation to continue experiencing beloved 16-bit games. Modern emulators supported unlimited save states that freeze gameplay at a moment's notice. This allowed enjoying even sprawling JRPGs across intermittent play sessions. 
Another option involved flash cartridges like the Super EverDrive. Compatible with real SNES consoles, their onboard storage functioned much like the original cartridge batteries. Except data could be quickly saved to and loaded from a removable microSD card. Both emulation and flash carts ensured the entire SNES library remained fully playable for new generations.
### A Selection of Must-Play SNES Games
The SNES catalog is filled with timeless classics. Super Metroid set the standard for 2D action-adventure with its atmospheric world and Samus' expansive moveset. EarthBound drew players into a quirky, heartfelt take on the RPG formula. Platforming perfection arrived via Super Mario World, with its inventive level design and Yoshi sidekick. 
The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past defined the top-down Zelda style for years to come. Fighting fans face-melted over Street Fighter II, while Square Enix hit an early peak with Final Fantasy VI. And Donkey Kong Country's visuals wowed alongside its challenging Kong-tained escapades. Deep cuts like Demon's Crest and Chrono Trigger proved the system's range.
