## Getting Started with Online Gaming
Gaming online provided an opportunity for many groups to continue playing their favorite tabletop roleplaying games despite social distancing restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using virtual platforms like Roll20, Discord and Zoom allowed gamers to explore a variety of systems from Dungeons & Dragons 5e to Savage Worlds while staying safe at home. This opened up tabletop gaming to more people by removing geographical barriers.
### Play-by-Post Games
Some GMs ran long-form play-by-post games across multiple platforms featuring systems like Dungeons & Dragons, Call of Cthulhu and Star Wars. These asynchronous style games emphasized roleplaying over strict mechanics. Players could contribute at their own pace which made them accessible for busy schedules.

### Regular Online Sessions  
A few groups met weekly for scheduled online sessions using video conferencing and virtual tabletops. Games generally lasted 2-3 hours and covered different RPGs from D&D to smaller indie titles like Ryuutama. Being able to easily gather friends virtually kept the adventure moving despite real-world restrictions.
### Homebrew Content Galore
One creative GM shared a wealth of original campaign materials and rules-lite systems they developed for online play. This included the unique fantasy world of The Cracked Kingdom and streamlined roleplaying games suited for virtual tables. Homebrew content helped gamers explore new stories and systems together.
## Expanding Access to the Hobby
Online platforms helped tabletop roleplaying grow its audience even during a global pandemic. More variety in schedules, systems and online tools meant finding a game was within reach.
### Live Video Game Nights  
One DM ran Sunday games through Zoom video chat looking to fill their last open seat. Relying on tools everyone already had access to through computers and phones lowered barriers to entry. Their group happily played through 5e adventures together each week.
### Health Issues and Scheduling Changes
A Savage Worlds campaign took a break when real-life responsibilities changed its GM's availability. However, players looked forward to continuing the Deadlands setting once it restarted online. Another group hoped virtual sessions could let their planned new RPG program take shape depending on work schedules. Digital play proved adaptable to life's ebbs and flows. 
### A Viking Mystery unfolding
Preparing for an epic new Norse-themed Mythras campaign, one DM dove into additional worldbuilding for their homemade setting. Tabletop gaming provided an engaging creative outlet. Systems like Runequest and Ygddrasill also caught their interest for capturing the campaign's atmosphere and themes authentically.
### Blending Online and Offline
One regular gaming club combined virtual meetings with limited in-person sessions respecting guidelines. Another finished development of their printed Troubleshooters materials through online brainstorming. Communities supported each other innovating new ways to enjoy their shared hobby.
## Conclusion
Online tools opened new possibilities for tabletop roleplaying during the COVID-19 pandemic. Groups utilized various virtual platforms and game systems to continue adventures together safely from a distance. Creativity around schedules, homebrew content and blended online/offline play helped gaming thrive. With ongoing accessibility, the future remains bright for online tabletop roleplaying.
