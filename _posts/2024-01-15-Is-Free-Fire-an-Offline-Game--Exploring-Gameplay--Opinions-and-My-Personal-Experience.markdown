### Free Fire is an Online Game
Free Fire is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by Garena for Android and iOS. The game does not have an offline single-player mode, and players must connect to Free Fire's servers via an internet connection to play matches against other online users.

### Gameplay Modes and Strategy  
Free Fire offers various playable modes including classic battle royale, clash squad, and custom rooms. In the classic solo, duo, or squad mode, up to 50 players drop onto an island and compete to be the last one standing. Players can choose landing spots, loot weapons/gear, and employ tactics like camping or pushing enemy squads. Clash squad is a 4v4 team deathmatch mode played in short 3-minute rounds.
### Reasons for Free Fire's Popularity
Free Fire has amassed a huge global player base due in large part to its accessibility on mobile. The game's relatively low device requirements and smaller file size allow it to run smoothly even on lower-end smartphones. Free Fire also incorporates social elements like guilds and voice chat that foster community engagement among players. Frequent updates keep the gameplay fresh with new weapons, characters, and other features.
### My Changing Perspective Over Time
When I first started playing Free Fire in 2018, I was immediately drawn in by the fast-paced battle royale gameplay. However, over time I began to feel the repetitive nature of grinding for upgrades became tedious. I also noticed the game monopolizing too much of my free time that could have been spent on other meaningful pursuits. My once passionate interest in the game slowly faded.
### Responding to Account Suspension
In early 2020, my Free Fire account got temporarily suspended for a policy violation I was unaware of. This deeply frustrated me as I had invested considerable time and even money into the account over nearly two years. I submitted an appeal to Garena but they were unable to lift the ban. This soured my experience further and pushed me closer to eventually quitting the game.
### Earning Through Free Fire Content Creation
At the peak of my Free Fire obsession in late 2018, I started a YouTube channel focused on game tutorials, tips & tricks, and livestreams. Within a few months, my channel amassed over 50k subscribers and I was earning a decent side income from monetization. However, as my own gameplay declined so did my channel's growth and revenue. Maintaining a Free Fire-focused channel was no longer sustainable for me.
### Free Fire's Potential to Change Lives
There are inspiring real-life stories of Free Fire players in developing countries utilizing the game's platform tournaments and esports leagues to achieve fame and financial success. Some top players have secured lucrative sponsorship deals and even represented their nations internationally. For people living in poverty, Free Fire provided a rare pathway to uplift their economic conditions through skill and dedication in the game.
### Motivations for Playing Decrease Over Time  
Initially I was motivated to play Free Fire by the novelty, challenge of the battle royale gameplay, and goal of ranking up. However, as the gameplay loop became routine, my motivations eroded. I no longer felt compelled to grind every day or participate in competitive modes and tournaments like before. Other hobbies and responsibilities began taking priority over the game in my spare time.
### Reflecting on the Possibility of Returning to the Game in Future
While I no longer regularly play Free Fire now, I do look back at times with nostalgia for my most engaged period in the game. Who knows, in the future I may return for a casual session now and then if a major new feature or mode is released. But for now, I've moved on to other mobile games and pursuits that better align with my current lifestyle and priorities. My time with Free Fire was undoubtedly memorable, for better and worse.
