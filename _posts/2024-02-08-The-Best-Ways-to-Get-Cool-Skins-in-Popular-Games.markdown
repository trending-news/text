### Free Methods in Warpath
Warpath offers several free ways for players to earn new skins without spending any real cash. One great option is by completing special events that run periodically in-game. These events will task players with accomplishing various missions and milestones, with skin fragments and sometimes whole skins as rewards. 
Daily login bonuses are another consistent free source of skin fragments. Logging in each day guarantees players earn a portion of what they need to fully unlock a new skin over time. Certain modes like PVP also provide fragment rewards just for ranking up through the ranks with higher tiers dishing out complete skins. 
Finally, expanding and upgrading your base in Warpath opens up visual bonuses including unique base skins. Players can freely customize their fortress exterior without any additional costs.

### Paid Methods in Warpath 
Of course, the quickest paths to new skins involve opening up your wallet. Warpath's in-game store enables direct purchase of individual skins or curated sets for a set price in diamonds, the game's premium currency. 
Lucky draws periodically offer a chance to spend a set amount of diamonds with the opportunity to win rare and desirable skins as prizes. Season passes that run for a few months also provide multiple guaranteed skins upon reaching certain reward tiers with diamonds.
### Free Methods in Valorant 
Riot's tactical shooter Valorant takes a similar contract approach to its free skins. By completing missions linked to each agent, players can upgrade the contract to tier 10 to unlock a free weapon skin themed after that agent. Daily and weekly challenges also dole out experience to progress multiple agent contracts at once.
Occasionally, linking a Prime Gaming account will grant free gun buddies, player cards or other bonus cosmetics. It's a small perk but any free content is worthwhile.
### Paid Methods in Valorant
For those seeking specific skins immediately, the in-game store allows direct purchase using Valorant Points, the premium currency. Individual skins or entire collections can be obtained. 
Every week, the Night Market rolls through offering steep discounts on a curated selection of skins for those willing to spend some VP. Battle passes that run the duration of an act season also reward skins through premium and free tracks.
### Other Ways to Obtain Skins
Outside of each game's standard economy, other opportunities exist to expand collections. In Valorant, it's possible to trade skins with others who have maintained a friends list relationship for 30+ days. 
Opening loot boxes earned in games like League of Legends on occasion yields cross-game skins. Special promotional bundles and event passes sometimes make select skins accessible regardless of the player's main preferred title.
### Popular and Favorite Skins
Browsing community threads on Reddit and forums provide a sense of the most beloved designs across different genres. The colorful and flashy skins in Fortnite tend to stand out. Similarly eye-catching sets dominate players' top picks for Warpath and Valorant as well. 
Meanwhile, the unattainable 'Blackiimov' and 'Howl' from CS:GO have achieved legendary status due to their rarity. 'Judgement Kayle' and past ranked rewards remain highly coveted in League of Legends.
### Saving Currency and Patience
While the temptation exists to spend regularly, patience in amassing in-game funds yields benefits. Login bonuses, mission rewards and Amazon Prime/Twitch Prime bonuses add up over time when saved. This allows selecting almost any skin directly down the line. 
Impulse buys tend to leave one's balance drained rather than working toward a specific expensive skin goal. Developing the willpower to save optimizes the free and paid earning potential within any game's economy.
### Outlook on Trading
Due to its heavy reliance on loot boxes for monetization, Riot has stood firm that trading will never be implemented in Valorant. This prevents real money transactions from negatively influencing the game. 
Games like CS:GO that do facilitate trading between players involve significant grind to build an attractive inventory for cashing out. There are also risks of account theft or market manipulation to navigate carefully.
### Combining Methods for Collections
The most effective approach combines both free and paid avenues consistently over weeks and months. Contracts, daily rewards, login bonuses slowly chip away while targeted purchases fill gaps. Season passes efficiently bundle multiple skins into one modest investment.
By utilizing every method strategically, even free-to-play only players can develop impressive long-term collections that turn heads. It requires patience but ensures nothing is left on the table across a player's favorite supported titles.
### In Summary
Whether looking to stand out on the battlefield or personalize virtual spaces, cool cosmetics add fun dimensions to games. The top titles make skins broadly accessible through balanced free and premium economics. Smart savers wanting specific designs just require time and discipline saving currency patiently across outlets. Combining all avenues maximizes any collection without breaking the bank. With effort, even free players can flaunt sought after rare skins.
