### Securing Your Devices   
Deactivating all devices linked to your PSN account from your device management page is the first step in securing your account after a compromise. Signing out of all devices from your account's security page removes any lingering login credentials that may allow unauthorized access. It's important to wipe all saved login information from all potentially compromised devices to block further access.

### Changing Login Credentials
Altering your PSN password is a must after a security breach. Choosing a new, complex password along with enabling two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of protection beyond just a password. Two-factor authentication requires providing a secondary code or approval during login, making it much harder for hackers to gain unauthorized access even if they have your password. 
### Investigating Unauthorized Access
Taking a close look at login history and linked devices shows where and when the account was last accessed without permission. Reading messages, viewing downloads or checking trophies earned while the account was compromised helps identify what was done during that time. This information assists in determining the scope of the security incident and helps target specific areas for added protection going forward.
### Removing Any Saved Payment Methods   
Once verified as the true account owner, deleting saved credit cards and PayPal accounts prevents continued misuse of payment methods on file. Hackers may have used linked payment details to purchase games, subscriptions or other digital items at your expense. Removing financial information stops further fraudulent charges from occurring on compromised accounts.
### Filing a Support Ticket
Contacting official PlayStation support by web form or phone officially reports the unauthorized access incident and requests an investigation. Providing login histories, suspicious activity logs and any other available evidence helps speed up the review process. Support agents work to determine what data was accessed, restore full ownership rights and take steps to prevent future unauthorized logins on the compromised account.
### Potential Account Actions and Notifications
Depending on the investigation findings, accounts involved in hacking or other serious policy violations face temporary or permanent suspension. Notifications via email keep you informed of any actions or outcomes from the security review. This allows addressing concerns through official support channels if needed.
### Strengthening Long-Term Security
Using unique, complex passwords on all accounts rather than reusing the same credential across services prevents a single breach from exposing multiple profiles. Regularly checking recent login locations and activities through the security dashboard detects suspicious access attempts. Early warnings allow quick password changes before hackers can perform damaging actions. Staying vigilant defends against future compromise attempts.
### Summary 
Securing devices, changing passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, removing payment data, filing a report, investigating access history and strengthening overall online security restores control of a compromised PSN account. Taking prompt action blocks further unauthorized access while supporting an official investigation protects gamer data and prevents repeat incidents going forward. Vigilance and safe account practices are key to maintaining security after a breach.
