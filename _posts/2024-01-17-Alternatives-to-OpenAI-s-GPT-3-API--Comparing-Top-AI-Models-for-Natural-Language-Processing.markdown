## Introduction
OpenAI's breakthrough language model GPT-3 has transformed NLP but accessibility is limited due to its high performance capabilities. This post compares top alternatives that provide similar NLP capabilities through public APIs. Factors like performance, cost, features, and licenses will be evaluated to help select the right solution for specific tasks and resources. 
### The Rapid Evolution of Language Models
Natural language processing has advanced rapidly thanks to new large language models. While no single option can replace GPT-3, these analyzed alternatives combine the latest innovations to support a wide range of tasks. As the field continues advancing, new models will emerge with even higher levels of understanding, generation, and performance.

## Meta's OPT
### An Open Alternative for AI Safety Research 
Meta's OPT model was released as an open source alternative to further the development of AI safety. At 175 billion parameters, it provides significant capabilities while balancing safety and transparency. Researchers can customize OPT through source code to better understand how large language models work and ensure their safe development. 
## Amazon's Alexa
### Multilingual Conversations at Scale
Amazon's 20 billion parameter multilingual model powers Alexa and was publicly released to enable seamless cross-lingual understanding and generation. While focused more on conversational abilities than broad generative models, Alexa remains freely accessible through APIs and SDKs. Its capabilities like translation have helped Alexa converse naturally with users around the world in over 100 languages.
## Microsoft Azure Services
### Integrating NLP into any Application
Microsoft's Azure platform offers a comprehensive suite of AI services through APIs and SDKs. Its Text Analytics API analyzes unstructured text for tasks such as sentiment analysis, entity recognition and key phrase extraction. Developers can integrate these capabilities directly into existing applications using popular programming languages like Python and JavaScript. The full Azure toolkit provides solutions for building complete custom NLP pipelines from data processing to model deployment.
## HuggingFace Transformers 
### Adapting Models for Any Task
HuggingFace's open source library makes it easy to use leading pretrained models from organizations like OpenAI, Google and AllenAI. Models such as BERT, GPT-2 and T5 can be loaded with just a few lines of code and then fine-tuned on downstream tasks using popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. With a large community of contributors constantly improving implementations, HuggingFace remains one of the best resources for applying the latest advances in NLP.
## EleutherAI's GPT-Neo
### Scaling Language Models Accessibly 
EleutherAI is developing more performant and safer alternatives to models like GPT-3 through their GPT-Neo project. While still in early stages at 2.7 billion parameters, GPT-Neo remains fully open source so its training process and capabilities remain transparent. Unlike with other large models, the entire code and trained weights are openly available. This allows researchers to build upon GPT-Neo to iteratively improve performance and safety as NLP assists more aspects of daily life. 
## Conclusion
While GPT-3 set a new standard, more options are emerging that combine high performance with accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and transparent development. By evaluating unique needs and available resources, the right combination of solutions from Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, HuggingFace and EleutherAI can be selected to support any NLP application. As new techniques are discovered, these alternatives will continue progressing to enable more human-level language processing.
