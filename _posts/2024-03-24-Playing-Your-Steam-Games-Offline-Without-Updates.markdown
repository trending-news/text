### Avoiding Updates For Limited Bandwidth
Steam game updates can be quite large, taking up valuable bandwidth if you have data caps or slow internet. By disabling automatic updates in Steam, you can avoid unwelcome downloads and play your favorite games without using up your internet allowance. This is especially useful if you want to game while traveling somewhere with spotty connectivity.

### Setting Steam to Only Install Updates Manually  
By changing your Steam library settings, you can ensure games will not update automatically in the background. Right click a game, select properties, and change the update option from automatic to manual. This allows you to control when updates are installed before launching a game so you aren't surprised by unexpected downloads.
### Bypassing Steam with Game Shortcuts
Creating desktop shortcuts directly to your game executables lets you launch games without going through Steam at all. This prevents Steam from doing any update checks since the games are not launching via the Steam client. It's a handy workaround if you want to preserve older versions of titles on your PC for nostalgia or modding purposes.
### Going into Offline Mode 
Putting your Steam account into offline mode cuts it off from internet access completely. No updates will start and online features like chat and achievements are unavailable. However, it ensures you can play single-player games even without a connection. It's useful for gaming on the go when you may have spotty WiFi access.
### Using Game Mods to Block Updates 
Some popular mods for Steam games come with separate launchers that bypass Steam altogether. Putting these launchers on your desktop allows launching games without Steam checks. As an added bonus, certain mods improve or expand upon vanilla games in fun new ways.
### Avoiding the Verify Option
When Steam offers to "verify integrity of game files," it actually checks for any missing or corrupted files compared to the latest version hosted online. This can inadvertently trigger downloads of sizable updates. By refraining from using this option, you prevent updates from installing.
### Not All Games Can Be Played Unupdated  
Unfortunately, there are limitations to playing Steam games offline indefinitely. Network checks and required online features mean some simply will not launch without being up to date. Workarounds like shortcuts may also fail to resolve version mismatch errors for certain titles.
### Preparing for Forced Updates
On rare occasions, Steam may force an important update that cannot be avoided. Having reliable internet access overnight or leaving your computer on standby for multi-GB downloads ensures the process finishes without hindering your gaming. It's wise to plan ahead just in case a mandatory patch is released.
