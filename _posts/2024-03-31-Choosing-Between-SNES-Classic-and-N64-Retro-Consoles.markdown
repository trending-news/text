The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) Classic Edition and original Nintendo 64 offer different experiences for retro gaming fans. There are several key factors to consider when deciding between the two iconic 90s consoles like available game libraries, controller design, local multiplayer options, and visual graphics. 
### Comparing Game Library Selection
While the Nintendo 64 was pioneering 3D gaming back in the day, it lacked strong third party support which limited its software library. Many publishers struggled with the limitations of cartridge storage and 64-bit graphics. As a result, its catalog ended up smaller with noticeable absences. On the other hand, the SNES Classic packs a curated selection of 20 titles spanning several genres from some of gaming's most beloved developers. Its lineup is hard to top with classics like Super Mario World, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Super Metroid, Final Fantasy VI, Mega Man X, EarthBound and more. Quality always triumphed over quantity with the SNES.

### Evaluating Controller Designs
The asymmetric Nintendo 64 controller may have enabled more buttons for 3D games but many players found it unwieldy and awkward especially for 2D titles. Its complex layout wasn't always intuitive. In comparison, the SNES pad kept things simple with its classic D-pad and face buttons, making it comfortable and familiar to use across a wide variety of game genres. Emulation allows using keyboard controls which lacks the authentic retro feel but provides useful save states when playing on original hardware isn't possible. 
### Analyzing Local Multiplayer Offerings
When it comes to local multiplayer fun, the Nintendo 64 shines by supporting up to four players simultaneously thanks to its expansion pak and various adapters. Classics like Mario Kart 64, GoldenEye 007 and NFL Blitz were a blast with friends in the same room. Its multiplayer games also remain enjoyable alone using the AI bots to substitute for human opponents. However, the SNES lacked robust local co-op support in many of its big titles besides a few exceptions like Super Mario World and FIFA International Soccer. Still, both provided memories of lively couch multiplayer sessions back in the day.
### Comparing Visual Fidelity 
While the N64 pushed graphical boundaries as one of the earliest 3D consoles, its primitive 3D sprites and textures haven't aged as gracefully compared to the SNES' beautifully drawn 2D pixel art. Pixilated 16-bit graphics maintain their visual charm decades later unlike the rough polygons of early 3D. Pixel perfection endures where crude polygonal modeling succumbed to higher definition standards. Of course, visuals alone don't determine a game's quality but they do impact first impressions and nostalgia. 
### Evaluating Portability Options
Emulated versions of both classic systems allow experiencing their retro libraries on newer devices, offering portable gaming outside the living room. However, the SNES Classic provides the most seamless plug-and-play experience straight from the box without additional setup. Just plug it in and over 20 SNES games are instantly accessible on the HDMI-enabled console with original-style wired controllers. Raspberry Pi DIY projects require more assembly for a multi-system emulation machine. 
### Considering Alternative Setups
For those seeking to expand beyond a single console's catalog, low-cost mini PC options like Raspberry Pi have grown into capable retro gaming machines. A Raspberry Pi can be configured to play ROMS from several classic systems for well under $100 total after buying the basic components. But for those wanting simplicity above all else, an official plug-and-play mini-console remains the path of least resistance for its dedicated retro library and controller accuracy.
### Reviewing Emulator Upsides 
While emulation can't perfectly recreate the tactile feeling of original hardware, it does provide certain advantages not possible on vintage gear. Save states allow pausing right before failure and reloading to bypass frustrating challenges, preserving the fun while cutting out tedium and repetition. Digital preservation also helps avoid issues like faulty cartridges, damaged consoles, missing components or degraded plastic over decades of use and storage. 
### Determining the Superior retro machine
All things considered, the SNES Classic Edition earns a slight overall recommendation for its small but mighty software selection containing numerous all-time classics, convenient plug-and-play functionality emulating the original 16-bit machine, and simplicity of controls appreciated by players of all ages and gaming experience levels. However, Nintendo 64 loyalists shouldn't feel overlooked, as its predecessor also holds up as a pioneering 3D arena and local multiplayer party powerhouse with depth beyond just gameplay. Ultimately, both mini-consoles fuel passionate retro feelings and deliver enjoyable digital nostalgia trips to the 1990s gaming golden age.
