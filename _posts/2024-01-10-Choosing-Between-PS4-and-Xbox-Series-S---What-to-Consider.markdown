## Introduction
The PS4 and Xbox Series S are two of the most popular video game consoles on the market today. However, choosing between the two can be difficult as there are many factors to consider. This guide will break down the key differences to help determine which system might be the best fit based on your needs, budget, and gaming preferences. 
### Looking at the Options
Both consoles offer great value for gamers but have notable pros and cons compared to each other. The PS4 is the older system but provides the flexibility of physical discs while the Series S is a newer, all-digital option. Things like performance capabilities, exclusive game libraries, subscription models, and future support will impact the gaming experience over the long run. Understanding how each console satisfies different priorities can help make the decision easier.

## Console Hardware and Performance
### Graphics and Processing Power 
The Xbox Series S, as the newer console, has more advanced hardware capabilities like supporting ray tracing for more realistic lighting and shadow effects in games. While the PS4 can still run modern titles, it does show its age graphically compared to the crisper visuals on Series S. The PS4 Pro upgraded model does feature a graphical boost over the original PS4 but is still outmatched by Series S. Load times are also snappier on Series S thanks to its solid state drive storage versus PS4's hard disk drive.
### Digital vs Physical Media
One major differentiator is the Series S lacks a disc drive, committing users solely to digital game downloads from the Microsoft Store. The PS4 standard and Pro models both retain optical disc drives, allowing physical media to be used. This provides more flexibility to purchase pre-owned discs or borrow/trade between friends. However, digital downloads are more convenient and don't risk discreader issues.
## Exclusives and Backwards Compatibility
### Exclusive Franchises  
Both consoles have iconic exclusive franchises that may appeal more depending on gaming tastes. The PS4 is home to acclaimed single-player exclusives like God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Bloodborne and others that push creative boundaries. Meanwhile the Xbox ecosystem spans multiple consoles with franchises like Forza, Gears of War, and Halo appealing more to multiplayer fans.
### Backwards Compatibility
Another major factor is how each console handles older games. The Series S supports a vast library of Xbox One and Xbox/Xbox 360 games through backwards compatibility. Meanwhile the PS4 is limited only to PS4 games since it cannot play PS3/PS2/PS1 games. Some popular PS4 games also may never be playable on the upcoming PS5 either. This broader backwards compatibility gives Series S users ongoing access to more games.
## Value and Subscription Services
### Game Prices Over Time  
Digital games priced uniformly on Series S through its online store but PS4 discs frequently drop in price pre-owned or during sales. Pre-owned discs in particular let savvy PS4 owners recoup costs by reselling when finished. However digital convenience comes at the cost of inability to trade-in or resell downloads later. 
### Subscription Value
While not required, an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription unlocks an immense library of 100+ games for download as well as online multiplayer access. This delivers phenomenal value but ongoing subscription fees are a factor. PS4 multiplayer remains free without subscriptions so upfront costs are lower, though digital sales are the only method to build a library long-term.
## Online Features and Multiplayer
### Connectivity Requirements  
A key difference is Xbox Live Gold or Game Pass membership becomes mandatory for Series S owners to play online multiplayer games with friends. Meanwhile PS4 allows completely free online access for cooperative/competitive play without subscriptions. This makes PS4 slightly more affordable if multiplayer gaming is a high priority regularly. However Game Pass does essentially bundle online features and its entire library for one low monthly fee. 
## Compatibility and Long-term Support
### Future-proofing the Investment
Sony has planned to phase out support for the PS4 by 2025 which marks over a decade of use. In contrast, the Series S is designed as a long-term investment being fully backwards compatible with future games on Xbox Series X/S as well as the ability to stream Xbox games. This extended support ensures the library and online services remain available well into the next console generation.
## Choosing Based on Budget   
### Upfront Purchase vs Overall Value
For gamers on a budget, the upfront $300 MSRP of the PS4 makes it very appealing as a more affordable entry point into current-gen gaming. However the Series S delivers better performance and value through its $300 all-digital approach bundled with Game Pass subscriptions. Weighing long-term usage, overall costs, and planned longevity can make Series S the wiser investment despite higher initial outlay depending on gaming habits.
## Personal Factors to Consider
### Controller Preferences
Ergonomics and button layout preferences between the Xbox controller and DualShock 4 are very personal. Testing both in-store can help decide which interface feels best. The Series S does let pairing other Bluetooth controllers as an option too.
### Internet Connectivity
Downloading new Series S games demands stable, high-speed internet which isn't an issue for all areas. Data caps or unreliable connectivity could hinder the digital-only experience.
## Conclusion
Both PlayStation 4 and Xbox Series S deliver fantastic gaming experiences for their price points. The right choice depends on priorities like library access, performance needs, and budget plans. Weighing factors like exclusive games, subscription costs, and long-term support help determine which console maximizes enjoyment and value over the ownership period. With substantial libraries available, either makes for an outstanding entry into current-gen gaming.
