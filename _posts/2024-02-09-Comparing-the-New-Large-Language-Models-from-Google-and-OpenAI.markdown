### Capabilities
Google's new language model Gemini is capable of more than just natural language processing. As a multimodal model, Gemini can understand images, text and audio simultaneously. This allows it to have more contextual understanding of the world. While OpenAI's GPT-4 is primarily focused on natural language, it has recently gained the ability to understand and discuss videos as well. 
On many NLP benchmarks, both models perform extremely well. Gemini and GPT-4 can answer questions with a high degree of accuracy, summarize texts, generate new texts and more. However, Gemini may have an edge when it comes to reasoning abilities due to its multimodal nature. Being able to understand different types of inputs at once gives it a more holistic view of problems.

### Accessibility
While both companies want to make their models helpful, accessibility is still limited for safety and research purposes. Gemini is only being shared with a few select partners through Google's AI Test Kitchen initiative. They are focusing the model on high-impact tasks like healthcare. Similarly, OpenAI has not widely released GPT-4 and is still evaluating potential applications. Their aim is to provide limited API access to approved users once the model is deemed safe enough. 
### Strengths and Weaknesses
One clear strength of Gemini is its multimodality allowing it to truly comprehend different types of information simultaneously. This opens up possibilities in fields like education that involve videos, images and text. GPT-4 meanwhile, continues to get better at a wide range of natural language tasks through continued training. Both models also integrate techniques to mitigate issues like bias, toxicity and factuality to different extents.
However, neither is available to general users yet which limits real-world testing and use cases. Bias also remains a problem since both were trained on huge web corpora containing societal biases. The closed access also stifles independent evaluation of the models. Additionally, while helpful for many tasks, it is uncertain how creative or imaginative these giant models can be.
### Choosing a Model
There are many factors to consider when choosing between Gemini and GPT-4. The most important would be identifying your specific needs and goals for the project. If it requires understanding of visual media, Gemini would have an advantage. But if it only involves text, GPT-4 may suffice. User experience is also key - the model must integrate smoothly. 
Ethical issues around bias, factuality, privacy and the companies' approaches to safety are essential considerations. Potential for progressing capabilities over time based on each company's research areas and priorities should factor in as well if the task may evolve. Ultimately, the best option depends highly on individual use cases and their alignment with each model's strengths.
### No Clear Winner 
Both Gemini and GPT-4 represent major advances in AI. However, neither can truly be called a clear winner since both are still rapidly improving based on ongoing research and iterations. What one excels at today may change tomorrow as the models incorporate new techniques. Additionally, their capabilities are so broad that different tasks may favor different approaches. 
Rather than compete, they seem poised to find many complementary applications. As accessibility expands safely in the future, both will prove valuable to various domains. The companies also continue collaborating to some extent on safety research. Overall, both Google and OpenAI are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with language models, to the benefit of their overall potential to help humanity.
### Conclusion
In conclusion, while Gemini and GPT-4 currently have certain advantages respectively, neither can be called the ultimate winner. As AI safety research progresses and capabilities increase through iterations, both models will evolve further. They already represent massive leaps for the field. Going forward, expanded accessibility depending on use cases and priorities is what will drive real-world impact. Both Google and OpenAI deserve praise for these accomplishments and commitment to oversight that enables helpful application of their powerful language models.
