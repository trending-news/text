## The Christmas Tree
Ever since Germans brought the Christmas tree tradition to England in the 19th century, the Christmas tree has become a ubiquitous wintertime symbol of holiday festivities across the world. Composed of fragrant evergreen branches, the Christmas tree represents everlasting life and remembrance of God’s eternal love. Traditionally, an angel or star topped tree points upwards to symbolize looking to heaven. According to tradition, Martin Luther was the first to adorn a tree with candles in the 16th century to mimic the beauty of the stars glowing through a forest at night for his children. Now a staple symbol of Christmas, finding the perfect tree to bring holiday cheer and magic to any home has become an annual ritual for many families.
### Origins and Traditions
Although evergreen trees like fir, pine and spruce were used as far back as the 16th century by Northern Europeans to celebrate winter solstice festivals, it was German settlers who brought the Christmas tree tradition to America in the 1830s. In 1846, Britain's Prince Albert helped popularize the Christmas tree in England after being impressed by a tree at a friend's house. He brought the idea and placed the first Christmas tree in Windsor Castle for a royal family Christmas. Queen Victoria's enthusiasm for Christmas trees then made them famous throughout English-speaking world. Germany continues as a big producer of Christmas trees while North America imports millions of trees from Europe during the holidays. Most families have carved out a special night to enjoy decorating the tree with ornaments, garland and lights as a way to bring holiday cheer into their homes.

## Nativity Scenes
### Symbolism of the Nativity
Nativity scenes first began appearing in churches and homes across Italy in 1223 to help illustrate the Christmas story to a public that was mostly illiterate. Also known as a creche, crèche or presepio in Italian, nativity scenes recreate Jesus's birth in the small town of Bethlehem by featuring figurines of Mary, Joseph, Baby Jesus in the manger along with farm animals. Often Wise Men, shepherds and angels are included as well. Recreating the humble stable setting where Jesus was born helps remind Christians what Christmas represents - the celebration of God sending his son to earth. Nativity scenes became especially popular in Italy and remained central to Italian Christmas celebrations and traditions. While the Christian symbolism centers around the miraculous birth of Jesus, nativity scenes originated from ancient pagan mid-winter celebrations in Europe and keep alive the story of Christmas for believers and non-believers alike. Over the centuries, nativities have also become collectible art pieces crafted with incredible detail across all cultures.
### Regional Styles
Nativity scenes today span many styles and regional traditions but maintain their core religious meaning. In Naples famous 'Presepi' are made using locally produced terracotta figurines and elaborate multi-scene landscapes. Across Sicily, detailed nativities made from painted terracotta, cork or wood often incorporate over 100 figurines in vibrant folk costumes within intricate rural settings. Along the Amalfi Coast, moss and dried flowers are used alongside figurines to craft rustic seaside nativities. Across Colombia, Venezuela and parts of South America, unique life-sized nativities called 'Pesebres' are performed by actors during Las Posadas celebrations in December replicating the journey to Bethlehem. No matter the style, nativity scenes continue spreading Christmas joy by retelling through figurines the most important story in Christianity.
## Holly and Mistletoe
### Symbolism of Evergreens
Evergreen plants like holly and mistletoe have long represented everlasting life and remembrance during winter solstice festivals in European traditions. For Christians, holly came to symbolize Christ's crown of thorns from its prickly leaves while its red berries represent his blood. Considered a plant of peace, holly brought good fortune and protection to homes during winter. Mistletoe carried pagan meanings of fertility, life and love but was later adopted into Christmas celebrations. According to legend, mistletoe received its tradition of being kissed under after a rivalry between Greek gods where an oak tree sheltered an injured god from an enemy only to be struck down by lightning for doing so. Zeus declared the oak tree's branches would never die out of regret and mistletoe was born from the oak's seed, retaining its ability to bring good fortune.
### Traditions of Holly and Mistletoe
Today, decorating homes and churches with holly and mistletoe during Christmas helps celebrate its symbolism of eternal life. Sprigs of mistletoe are often hung in doorways of homes and workplaces with the expectation of receiving a kiss from anyone who happens to be standing under the same hanging bunch. This tradition has added the idea of mischievous romance to wintertime Christmas decor. Holly berries and mistletoe berries also feature prominently in many seasonal foods, wreaths and crafts. Discovering holly and mistletoe used as a seasonal decoration brings a sense of magic mirroring the Christian story of eternal life promised through Jesus's birth. While based in pagan symbols, holly and mistletoe remain uniquely tied to Christmas celebrations in signifying love, luck and fond seasonal memories.
## Wreaths
### Symbolism of the Wreath Shape
The circular shape of a wreath symbolizes love that has no beginning or end much like God’s love depicted around Christmas. Evergreens used in wreaths also tie them to representing eternal life. Wreaths may have originated from pagan midwinter traditions as symbols of life or crowns worn by gods and goddesses. For Christians, the circular wreath came to symbolize the eternal nature of Jesus Christ. Hanging wreaths on doors especially during the holiday season is thought to bring the welcoming spirit of Christmas to any home. Wreaths traditionally incorporate holly, pinecones, berries and ribbon creating festive filler that brings an inviting holiday touch. Handcrafting seasonal wreaths from fragrant greens has become a beloved Christmas tradition passed down through generations.
### Door Wreath Traditions
Hanging a cheerful wreath on the front door is a longtime Christmas custom signaling to visitors that the home’s inhabitants celebrate the season. Fresh or artificial wreaths may be hung throughout December and display vibrant colors and decor like velvet ribbons, mini lights and pinecones. Door wreaths act as a preview to the seasonal cheer awaiting guests inside and help spread neighborhood Christmas cheer. Starting new wreath traditions like crafting matching family wreaths or hosting neighborhood wreath-making parties are ways communities celebrate together. No matter the style or size, door wreaths make any home feel festive by bringing nature’s evergreen symbolism of eternal love to the front entrance during the holidays.
## Angels
### Angel Symbolism
Angels represent heavenly messengers and hold significance as figures who announced Jesus’s birth to shepherds as told in the nativity story. Angel figurines, sculptures and paintings serve as Christian symbols of God’s divine plan unfolding through his son’s incarnation. Most traditional angel representations show them wearing flowing robes with wings as a symbol of their role of bearing messages between heaven and humanity. In Annunciation scenes, angels often represent the Archangel Gabriel announcing to Mary that she would conceive and bear Jesus. Topping Christmas trees or perched on branches, angel ornaments serve as a reminder that the story of Christmas centers around an angelic announcement bringing the joyful message that Jesus had come.
### Angel Christmas Traditions

Common traditions include collecting angel figurines, painting or carvings that bring a celestial presence. Angel tree-toppers symbolize being guided to the truth and holiness of Christmas. Families may light candles near angel figurines as a reminder of God's light presence in the world. Singing joyful Christmas carols referring to angels adds to the celebratory atmosphere. Angel imagery conveys the message that Christian beliefs tie Christmas to God's promises fulfilled in Jesus as the light of the world, guided by angelic messengers heralding his miraculous birth. In these ways, angels remain an iconic Christmas symbol of God's grace.
## Christmas Colors
### Origin of Traditional Colors
The familiar festive colors of red, green, gold and silver seen everywhere at Christmastime come from long-held European traditions. Red originated from England representing Christ’s blood and from the red poinsettia flowers brought to Bethlehem by a young girl to give as a gift at Jesus’s manger. Evergreen’s year-round green foliage stood for new life and eternity. Shiny gold symbolized light, hope and wealth while silver was purity, charity and the star of Bethlehem guiding the wise men’s journey. These colors became widespread in Victorian Britain and the United States through Queen Victoria and Prince Albert’s popularization of their annual Christmas trees and decorating. Photos shared of their elaborate winter displays helped establish Christmas colors as we know them today.
### Modern Color Traditions
Fast forward to the present where Christmas remains filled with traditional vibrant shades. Red satin ribbons are entwined with green pine garlands adorning mantles, staircases and banisters.
