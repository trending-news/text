### Generating Game Concepts
While ideas can come from anywhere, focusing your brainstorming helps. Research popular genres and mechanics to spot trends. Refine ideas through testing - get feedback early to improve concepts. Document your final concept thoroughly in a design doc so everyone's on the same page. Having a clear vision is key.

### Choosing a Development Platform
For online games, engine choice matters. Unity and Unreal are great options, with 2D/3D support and multiplayer integration. For beginners, GameMaker Studio offers accessibility. Consider needs like programming skills and platforms. Choosing the right engine upfront eases development. 
### Building Foundational Elements  
With your concept and tools outlined, flesh out core design. Map levels, quests and gameplay loops to create engaging, progressive challenges. Bring your world to life visually with characters, environments and objects. Code core systems like movement to interact naturally. Add versatility by supporting solo and co-op play styles.
### Developing Online Infrastructure
Central to online games is robust online integration. Host the game on dedicated servers and connect players through matchmaking. Leaderboards, profiles and achievements fuel continued participation. Consider monetization carefully - implement strategies that enhance fun, not frustrate players. 
### Testing and Bug Squashing 
Get feedback frequently to refine your creation. Playtesting exposes issues to address. Identify and eliminate bugs thoroughly before release to ensure a smooth experience. Post-launch, continued fixes and performance optimizations maintain quality over the long run.
### Marketing and Building Community
Raising awareness requires utilizing applicable communities. Leverage social platforms and gaming forums to find potential players. Early Access and crowdfunding can gather support and polish the game. Providing your own active community supports future engagement. Partnering with online influencers expands reach.
### Delivering Ongoing Support
To retain players, consistent new content keeps the experience fresh and exciting. Listen attentively to feedback for continuous quality improvements. Extending the gameplay in new modes and characters extends longevity. Revenue from purchases fuels further ambitious development. 
### Business Operations and Success Factors
Monetization is key - strategies like free-to-play, subscriptions, or one-time sales must suit your game. Retain players through positive UX and attentive support. Analytics provide useful insights to guide enhancements. Updates should build on existing balance, not disrupt the fun. 
### Summary and Future Opportunities
This process overview covered essential development phases and strategies. Emerging blended realities will merge virtual and real worlds seamlessly. Ubiquitous access anytime, anywhere enables play on any device. Delivering continuously improving player experiences will determine long-term victories. The future remains bright for ambitious online games.
