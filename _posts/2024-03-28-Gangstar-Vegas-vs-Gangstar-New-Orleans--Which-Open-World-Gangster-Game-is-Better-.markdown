## Introduction
Gangstar Vegas and Gangstar New Orleans are two hugely popular free-to-play open world gangster games available on Android and iOS devices. Both games immerse players into the gritty underground worlds of organized crime in America's iconic cities. While they share many gameplay mechanics and thematic elements of controlling a street gang, there are also key differences that make one title a more enjoyable experience depending on a player's preferences and technical restrictions. Let's break down the major distinguishing factors of these two acclaimed open world crime games.
### Gameplay Differences
Gangstar Vegas takes a more open-ended approach to its gameplay by allowing unrestricted offline exploration of its vibrant open world recreation of Las Vegas. Players can freely roam the streets, complete missions and side activities, engage in frenetic gun battles, and rise up the criminal underworld at their own pace without an internet connection. On the other hand, Gangstar New Orleans mandates a persistent online connection due to its emphasis on competitively challenging story missions and multiplayer turf wars between player-led gangs. Progression is also more meticulously balanced through tough boss fights and narrative checkpoints. However, character customization and development is deeper in Gangstar Vegas with greater creative agency in custom styling weapons, vehicles and characters.

### Graphics and World Design
Visually, Gangstar Vegas is simply more polished and visually striking thanks to its uncanny digital re-creation of the flashy landmarks, casinos and neon signs of Sin City. Exploring the bright, busy streets feels like a vibrant interactive tour of Las Vegas. While Gangstar New Orleans faithfully recreates iconic New Orleans neighborhoods, the graphical presentation is less technically accomplished. That said, its open world is atmospheric and immersive in how random encounters and emergent activities unfold organically. Overall, Gangstar Vegas edges out in graphical fidelity but both cities feel alive through atmospheric ambient sound design and distinctive architectural personalities.
### Vehicles and Transportation  
Getting around the sprawling maps is smoother in Gangstar Vegas due to the wider array of accessible vehicles like sports cars, retro muscle cars, super bikes and speed boats that can be hijacked from NPCs on the fly. Racing and stunt driving is more fun thanks to land, sea and air craft handling with panache. Meanwhile, Gangstar New Orleans leans into cinematic heists and high stakes pursuit scenarios in boosted luxury vehicles. Customization is best in Gangstar Vegas where unique visual modifications can be applied to truly personalize rides. Overall, Vegas wins for transportation variety and customizability.
### Character Progression
Leveling up and gaining new skills is generally easier in Gangstar Vegas through an extensive assortment of repeatable side activities like illegal street races, protection rackets, weapon deals and treasure hunts sprinkled around the map. Progression feels more organic as abilities unlock after completing simple goals. Conversely, Gangstar New Orleans locks new attributes and perks behind arduous story mission checkpoints that push players to their limits in intense firefights and confrontation with rival crime families. Joining a network of interconnected gangs expands your operation, requiring tactical mastery in player-vs-player turf warfare and underworld politics. Both approaches are satisfying but Vegas edges out for its less punishing levelling curve. 
### Microtransactions and System Requirements  
On the business model front, Gangstar Vegas uses microtransactions more judiciously for optional vanity items and power-ups compared to the more essential role they play in advancing through Gangstar New Orleans at a reasonable pace. The technical bar is also lower for Vegas to run smoothly, even on lower-end smartphones. New Orleans demands high-end hardware and networking infrastructure for enjoyable framerates during intense city-scale battles. Overall, Vegas offers a more welcoming experience for casual players and those with budget devices with its less constrained free-to-play economy.
### Conclusion
For most players looking to dip their toes into organized virtual crime without aggressive monetization schemes or technical walls blocking basic enjoyment, Gangstar Vegas wins out as the superior open world gangster experience. Its wealth of accessible content in an obsessively detailed city and gentle learning curve makes it ideal for informal play sessions anywhere. Meanwhile, Gangstar New Orleans compels hardcore players seeking the intensity of a competitive online clan warfare experience in a beautifully artistic open world. No matter one's tastes, there is fun to be had in both of these digital playgrounds for aspiring street kings.
