### Early Beginnings in Silicon Valley
Sam Altman first discovered his interests in computer science while studying at Stanford University. Though he dropped out to pursue his first startup, Loopt, he had already gained significant technical expertise. At just 19 years old, he co-founded Loopt and took the lead in building core parts of the codebase. After growing Loopt into a successful mobile app used by millions, Altman led its acquisition by Green Dot for $43.4 million in 2012.
