## Introduction 
Hello everyone! Welcome to my guide on starting your journey of creating SNES games. The Super Nintendo Entertainment System, or SNES for short, is one of the most iconic game consoles from the early 90s. While creating games for modern platforms like PC, mobile, and consoles can require large teams and budgets, the SNES allowed for smaller indie developers to create games due to its simpler architecture. In this guide, I will cover the main aspects you need to consider when developing your own SNES game from start to finish - from choosing an engine, to programming basics, graphics, audio, and finally testing. By the end, you'll have the foundation to start building your first SNES game. Let's get started!
## Choosing a Game Engine
### SNES Development Kits 
One option is to use an official SNES development kit from Nintendo which includes hardware like cartridges, debuggers, and documentation. However, these kits can be expensive to obtain now since the SNES is a retro console. An alternative is to use an emulator-based development kit instead. Popular free and open source options include SNES9x, bsnes, Higan etc. These allow coding and testing games directly on your PC or Mac without requiring actual SNES cartridges.

### Tile-based or Sprites
When choosing an engine, consider if you want to develop a tile-based game like RPGs or platformers, or use individual sprites. Tile-based engines like SpaceEx provide tilemap and collision detection tools while sprite-kit engines are better for games like shooters using animated sprites. Most support features like palettes, sound and controller input required for a full featured game.
## Programming Basics for SNES
### Assembly vs High-Level Languages
Original SNES games were coded in Assembly to get optimal performance but modern engines allow C/C++ which are easier to learn and code in. Assembly is still needed to access certain low-level APIs unavailable in high-level languages. Most engines provide wrappers and functions to call Assembly routines without requiring deep Assembly knowledge. 
### Memory Management
The SNES has limited memory compared to modern systems. Proper memory management using techniques like bank switching of ROM is crucial. Engines abstract much of this complexity but understanding memory constraints helps optimization. Debugging memory issues requires assessing which routines are utilizing the most memory.
### Controllers and Input Handling
The SNES controller has directional pad, face buttons, shoulder buttons. Engines provide APIs to poll and read controller state to respond to player input. Implementing simple to advanced control schemes require handling button presses, releases, combinations. State machines are useful for complex context-aware control flows.
## Graphics and Sprites 
### Tilemaps and Tilesets
SNES displayed tile-based 2D graphics using tilemaps - grids of tiles from a tileset. Tilemap data described what tile image goes in each map position. Tilesets contain tile images which can be 8x8, 8x16 or larger. Engines include tilemap editors to visually create levels. 
### Sprite Layers and Priorities
Sprites are independent graphical objects that can be positioned freely. SNES supported between 32-128 simultaneous sprites on screen across different priority levels for special graphical effects. Proper use of layers keeps sprites appearing in the right order.
### Palettes and Colour Manipulation
The SNES displays 32 on-screen colours at once from a palette of 512. Palette manipulation allows more than 32 colours used by dynamically changing the palette. This is commonly used for colour cycling effects. Engines provide palette editing tools.
## Audio Implementation
### Sound Channels and Effects 
The SNES audio chip supports 4 simultaneous sound channels - square wave, triangle wave, noise and PCM sample playback. Complex sounds are created by combining waves on channels. Effects like pulse width modulation and envelope controls add expression.
### Music and Soundtracks
Music was usually pre-composed on a desktop tracker like Sunsoft's SoundTracker then coded into the game. Trackers play MIDI-like sequences of notes,instruments and effects. Tracks can be streamed sequentially for long songs. Some engines support drag-and-drop song editing.
### Audio Triggering and Control 
In-game audio needs triggering at the right moments like jumps, hits etc. Channels can be dynamically assigned to play samples/instruments. Audio status can be polled to sequence multiple sounds. Most engines abstract audio APIs but low-level control may require Assembly.
## Testing and Debugging
### Simulating In-Game Scenarios 
Thorough testing across all scenarios is important before release. Automated unit testing catches bugs early. Simulate different input sequences, enemy/level combos to identify crashes or illogical behavior. Milestones help track progress.
### Memory Management and Profile Guides 
Profile memory, processor usage and other resources at each stage. Address leaks and optimize strained code sections. Debuggers help step through code, examine variables and find errors. Logging helps trace program flow. 
### Troubleshooting Bugs
Common bugs include graphics glitches,freezes,crashes. Methodically decrease complexities to isolate root cause using debug print, comments. Cross-check against original specifications. Community help expands testing tools not catching issues. Fix, then retest before moving forward.
I hope you found this high-level guide helpful to get started in creating your own SNES game. The process is approachable even for beginners as long as each phase is learned step-by-step. Have fun and let me know if any topics need more explanation. Building retro console games teaches transferable programming and design principles applicable even for modern platforms.
