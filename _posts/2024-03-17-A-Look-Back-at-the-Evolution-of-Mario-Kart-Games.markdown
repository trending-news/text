## The Early Days of Mario Kart on SNES 
Super Mario Kart was released on the SNES in 1992 and revolutionized the racing genre with its fun and pick-up-and-play style. While the Mode 7 feature helped tracks feel more dynamic, the technical limitations of the console meant fully 3D graphics were still out of reach. The game included 8 playable characters like Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong and introduced core kart racing mechanics. Players could collect power ups around tracks like shells and bananas to throw at opponents. Though basic by today's standards, Mario Kart laid the foundations for the beloved series.
### SNES Classic Dominates Sales
Super Mario Kart was a massive success, becoming one of the best selling games on the SNES with over 8 million copies sold worldwide. Its innovative take on the racing genre captivated gamers looking for fun multiplayer mayhem on the couch. The pick-up-and-play style made it approachable for all skill levels. While graphics were anchored to 2D,Mode 7 effects like scaling and rotation injected new life into tracks.

## Mario Kart 64 Ushers in 3D 
The launch of the Nintendo 64 in 1996 marked Mario Kart's jump to full 3D. Mario Kart 64 expanded the roster to include favorites like Princess Peach, Yoshi and Wario. Tracks were fully navigable in three dimensions for the first time. A new stat system added more strategy by accounting for character weights and vehicle stats. Items were more varied, including three new retro-style tracks.
### Multiplayer Magic on N64 
Mario Kart 64 took the multiplayer action of the SNES original and magnified it on home televisions. Up to 4 people could duke it out locally or compete against the clock in time trial mode. While textures lacked detail by today's standards, the fully realized 3D tracks were a marvel. New battle arenas added another competitive layer beyond just racing. Mario Kart 64 shipped over 11 million copies, further cementing the series' popularity.
## GameCube's Double Dash Adds Unique Co-Op 
Released in 2003, Mario Kart: Double Dash!! for the Nintendo GameCube introduced some bold innovations. Two players could team up in a single kart, each controlling a driver with unique items. Strategic item switching added depth requiring coordination between teammates. Character stats were balanced differently than before. 
### 16 Dynamic Tracks
Sixteen vibrant tracks featured aquatic, desert and city themes with ramps exploiting the karts' hang-gliders and bouncing mushrooms. Anti-gravity segments flipped convention by racing upside down or around loop-de-loops. Bosses challenged players between races. Visually Double Dash pushed the GameCube's hardware, showcasing artistic direction becoming a hallmark.
## Wii Goes Mass Market
Mario Kart Wii launched in 2008 to widespread acclaim, attracting both devoted fans and whole new players. The hit Wii console broadened appeal to audiences beyond gamers. Motion controls translated steering intuitively for driving maneuvers. Online multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection encouraged endless hours playing with friends around the world.
### Remastered Retro Tracks
16 retro courses from earlier games received HD makeovers remastering fondest memories. "Rainbow Road" tracks tested driving skill and nerves on precarious paths. The battle mode map selection with customizable rules sparked savage living room multiplayer battles. By 2013 Mario Kart Wii had sold over 37 million units becoming the best selling Mario Kart title. 
## Mario Kart 7 Brings Mobile Raceway
The 2011 portable Mario Kart 7 on the Nintendo 3DS showed tracks could thrive confined to a tiny screen. Tilting and touch controls handled driving duties. Airships and submarines let players race underwater or through the skies on anti-gravity bikes. Online multiplayer was robust for on-the-go karting.
### Gliders Add New Dimension  
Gliders provided an innovative solution to 3D racing on such a small package. Players could literally glide and soar through courses, adding verticality beyond traditional road racing. Underwater segments switched to bubble-blowing for movement. While textures lacked the fidelity of home consoles, clever level design optimised the hardware. Over 22 million copies have been raced since launch.
## Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Sets a New Standard
Both the 2014 Wii U and enhanced 2017 Nintendo Switch versions of Mario Kart 8 refined the formula. Sharp HD visuals popped across varied landscapes from cityscapes to jungles. Anti-gravity zones segmented by pulsing ribbons subverted expectations remixing classic elements. Adaptive steering intelligently assisted less experienced players.
### Online Play Evolves
Online infrastructure matured from earlier iterations, now supporting global player matchmaking with optional regional matchups. Downloadable content packs injected new life for months after release. Miniature Battle Mode arenas retooled the fan favorite mode with tight confined spaces. Critics hailed it the best-looking and playing Mario Kart yet, moving over 35 million units sold.  
## Mario Kart Tour Tests Mobile Waters
The long-awaited mobile Mario Kart Tour soft launched in select regions in late 2019 introducing karting to phones worldwide. Simplified one-handed steering focused on pickup fun versus console depth. Continuous Tour Cups rotated new tracks and characters regularly for engagement. 
### Freemium Monetization 
However, reliance on microtransactions for upgrades and coveted high-end drivers within its gacha mechanics polarized fans. While visually appealing on small screens, the 'freemium' model strayed from traditional 'pay once to play' games. Ongoing live service aims to justify this model, but the adaptation faces questions around balancing accessibility and revenue. Only time will tell if this new direction satisfies.
## What's Next for Mario Kart? 
Across generations Mario Kart established itself as a racing juggernaut selling over 100 million copies worldwide spanning home and mobile consoles. The series continued to innovate without losing accessibility central to its appeal. Though Mario Kart 9 has not been announced for next generation systems yet, anticipation remains high. Will it take inspiration from retro courses remastered in previous HD renditions? Only Nintendo can say - but one thing is clear, the checkered flag will keep waving for Mario Kart's ongoing evolution.
