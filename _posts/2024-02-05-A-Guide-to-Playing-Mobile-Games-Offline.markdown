## Introduction
There are many ways to play mobile games without an internet connection. This guide will cover gameplay options for native Android games, emulation, and more. Sections include games from app stores, sideloaded APKs, emulators, and full system emulation. Playing mobile games offline opens up a whole new world of possibilities for gamers on the go.
### Native Android Games
Many popular mobile games are designed to be played fully offline once initial downloads are complete. Games installed from official app stores like the Google Play Store can often be launched without an internet connection after allowing additional files and resources to download over WiFi. Even if a native game does not explicitly support offline play, it may still function to some degree offline through sideloading the APK directly.

### Sideloading APK Files  
For players looking to take their mobile gaming beyond official stores, sideloading APK files is an effective method. Popular game APKs can usually be found through online searches with the title. Once the "Install apps from unknown sources" setting is enabled, tap the APK file in a file manager like Files by Google to install it. Some games may also require additional OBB files be placed in the OBB folder on the device's internal storage for full functionality offline.
### PPSSPP: A Gateway to the PSP Library
The popularity of emulators on Android opens up huge libraries of classic games that can be played offline. PPSSPP brings PlayStation Portable games to mobile through high-quality emulation. PSP ISO files for many major titles can be found with online searches. Once downloaded, they can be launched straight from the well-designed PPSSPP emulator for fully portable PSP gameplay. The emulator even supports configurable controls for on-screen controls or Bluetooth controllers. 
### Additional Emulators for Retro and Mobile Java Games  
Beyond PSP, other emulation options exist for taking mobile gaming offline. J2ME Loader simulates old Java-powered mobile phones, allowing hundreds of classic mobile Java games from the early 2000s to be played. It supports direct game JAR file installation. JoiPlay handles visual novel, RPG Maker and HTML5 games through compatibility layers. Both emulators let expansive game libraries be accessed anywhere once the emulator and games are downloaded.
### Full System Emulation of Consoles and Handhelds
For the most dedicated mobile gamers, console and handheld emulation is possible too. High-end Android devices can run emulators like Dolphin for GameCube and Wii, allowing games like The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker to be fully portable. PPSSPP shows even more demanding 3D emulation is achievable. Other excellent emulators include RetroArch for an all-in-one frontend and Emulators for specific consoles like PS1, PSP, Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS. Backups of game files known as ROMs and ISOs can unlock thousands of classic titles for offline mobile play.
### Popular Game Recommendations
