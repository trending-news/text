### Introduction
PlayStation Plus charges mandatory subscription fees for online play, even for games already owned by consumers. This started with Xbox Live Gold and was later copied by PlayStation. While subscriptions provide some free games each month, those games are only playable if the subscription remains active. Many players fondly remember being able to play online for free on older PlayStation consoles without extra fees. This post aims to discuss both the pros and cons of PlayStation Plus subscription fees from a consumer perspective.

### Background 
Sony began requiring a PlayStation Plus subscription for online multiplayer access after seeing the financial success of Microsoft's Xbox Live Gold model. The fees provide access to multiplayer gaming as well as a curated selection of "free" games each month. However, any games obtained through PlayStation Plus can only be played while the subscription remains active. Even single-player games from a user's older PlayStation Plus library will be inaccessible should their subscription lapse. 
### Arguments in Favor
Supporters claim the subscription fees help fund the online servers and infrastructure needed to support multiplayer gaming. PlayStation Plus also offers a constantly rotating selection of games at no additional cost each month. For some, these "free" titles provide worth even if they can only be played during the subscription period. Popular games are regularly included that save money compared to purchasing them separately.
### Arguments Against 
While subscription services do offer some benefits, critics argue players already pay substantial amounts for their games but face additional charges simply for online access - even with games they purchased separately. This double-dipping seems unjustified and greedy. Console makers earn sizeable profits from developers through licensing and storefront revenue sharing. Additional subscription fees on top of software and hardware sales are not truly necessary to maintain online services. Older PlayStation consoles supported online play without extra subscription costs, so mandatory fees now seem designed more for monetization than value-add.
### Impact on Gamers and Alternatives
The mandatory subscription model has pushed some fans away from PlayStation platforms entirely and toward cheaper PC alternatives like Steam that provide competitive online gaming at no subscription cost. Canceling a PlayStation Plus membership means losing access to any accumulated free game library - a realization that frustrates users who thought they owned rather than leased those titles. While Sony claims subscription value, many players simply want a return to the fairer and more consumer-friendly online and ownership models of the past. Advocacy could pressure Sony toward meaningful reforms.
### Sony's Perspective  
As a for-profit corporation, PlayStation Plus subscriptions generate consistent recurring revenue beyond one-time hardware and software sales - maximizing profits and shareholder value. Bundling free games with memberships helps build customer loyalty as those titles remain playable only while subscribed. However, without competitive pressures, subscriptions are unlikely to disappear. Growing consumer displeasure may eventually force Sony to reevaluate their current subscription-dependent business model.
### Impact on the Gaming Industry
PlayStation Plus has inspired similar mandatory subscription models from other console makers, setting a precedent that online multiplayer now requires an extra recurring fee rather than being a basic feature. This shifts more power and profits to platforms while eroding consumer ownership perceptions. Platform holders increasingly view players as ongoing revenue streams rather than customers. Alternatives like purchasing single games on Steam show subscription-free gaming remains viable, suggesting mandated subscriptions are a business decision over necessity. The future likely holds subscription saturation or pushback as gamers grow tired of nickel-and-diming fees.
### Conclusion  
While PlayStation Plus offers some value through "free" games and online access, mandatory subscription fees represent an excessive monetization of the Playerbase through double-dipping. Alternatives demonstrate multiplayer gaming need not come bundled with subscriptions. Greater consumer advocacy may push Sony to adopt fairer policies restoring the pro-consumer approaches of past generations. Competition will be key - if players flock to platforms respecting ownership rather than dependence, industry practices could shift back toward valuing customers over ongoing revenue streams.
