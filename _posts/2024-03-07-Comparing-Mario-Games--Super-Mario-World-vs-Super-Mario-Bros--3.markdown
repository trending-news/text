## Introduction
The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) represented a massive technical leap forward from its predecessor, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). With improved graphics, sound capabilities, and overall processing power, developers were able to create games with more complex mechanics and gameplay. This included two landmark Mario platformers - Super Mario World and Super Mario Bros. 3. While both took advantage of the SNES's enhancements, they differ significantly in their level designs, power-ups, difficulty, and ultimately their legacy.
### Technical Differences Between Consoles
The SNES, released in 1990, used 16-bit architecture and advanced hardware compared to the 8-bit NES. It could output more colors, scale sprites, and play music with greater quality. This allowed for richer visually detailed worlds and more immersive audio in Super Mario World and SMB3.

## Gameplay Differences
### Level and Save Styles
Super Mario Bros. 3 levels tended to be shorter without any mid-point saves. Players had to complete an entire world in one go. Super Mario World had longer levels that could be exited at various points using secrets exits. Lives were also saved after each completed stage, lessening punishment for failure. 
### Power-Up Variety
While Super Mario World featured Yoshi as a mountable companion, Super Mario Bros. 3 introduced far more memorable and varied power-ups. Power-ups like the frog suit, Tanooki suit, and hammer suit added unique abilities that changed level strategies and kept gameplay fresh through frequent changes.
## Level Design
### Design Variety and Ambition
The worlds of Super Mario Bros. 3 felt grander in scope with settings like giant land, ice land, and sky castles. Its level architecture showed more ambition with interactive moving parts. Super Mario World levels often had a simpler design that was easier to fully explore once obtaining the feather power-up.
## Challenge and Difficulty
### Maintaining Challenge 
Super Mario Bros. 3 stayed challenging from beginning to end with hazards that could mean instant death. There were less opportunities for cheap or unintended deaths. In comparison, Super Mario World became too easy for skilled players to complete without much threat of losing lives later in the game.
## Music and Sound  
### Leveraging Advanced Hardware
Both scores are beloved for how they utilized the SNES's enhanced musical capabilities. Super Mario World's music helped craft the atmosphere of unique lands. However, Super Mario Bros. 3 tunes tended to be more varied and hummable between different worlds. Its music did a better job representing changing settings.
## Legacy and Influence
### pioneering Mechanics
Super Mario Bros. 3 was massively influential as a sequel by introducing power-ups, mechanics, and level designs that became series staples. Its experimentation pushed the boundaries of 2D platformers. Many of its ideas and concepts lived on in future Mario side-scrollers and beyond.  
## Preference and Nostalgia
### Childhood Perspectives
For many who played these titles as young kids, Super Mario World's mid-point save feature gave it an advantage in enjoyment. However, in retrospect, Super Mario Bros. 3 is more fondly remembered for taking greater risks to deliver a more finely tuned challenge from start to finish. Its expertly balanced difficulty has helped secure its reputation.
## Overall Assessment
### Peak 2D Mario Design
When assessing purely as platformer game design achievements, Super Mario Bros. 3 remains the pinnacle example. It achieved the perfect harmony of level aesthetic variety, clever power-ups, perilous obstacle placement, and a lasting challenge. The finesse of its sound design additionally cemented its status as the quintessential 2D side-scrolling Mario experience.
## Conclusion
While Super Mario World was a technical marvel that expanded the franchise, Super Mario Bros. 3 renewed intense excitement for challenging 2D Mario adventures. Its risk-taking level designs and balanced difficulty maintained fun without becoming punishingly hard. It rightfully holds the title as the single greatest 2D Mario game for establishing long-term standards and influencing the progression of the entire platformer genre. Both remain hugely influential classics, but SMB3 ultimately surpasses even its legendary predecessor in crafting the perfect 2D Mario experience.
