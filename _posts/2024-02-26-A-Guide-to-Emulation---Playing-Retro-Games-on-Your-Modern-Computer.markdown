## Introduction to Emulation
### What is Emulation?  
Emulation is the act of using a computer program called an emulator to mimic the functionality of a retro game console like the Super Nintendo or Sega Genesis on a modern computer or smartphone. Emulators work by virtually recreating the hardware and software experience of classic gaming systems in software. This allows users to play thousands of classic retro games from the 80s and 90s on modern devices.

### Benefits of Emulation
Emulation offers several benefits over buying and playing retro games on their original hardware. It allows gamers to preserve and continue playing older games that may be difficult to find physically or have incompatible hardware. Emulators also make classic games more convenient and accessible to play wherever you have a computer rather than needing the actual console. 
## Choosing an Emulator
### Popular Emulators 
There are many excellent emulation options available for different classic gaming systems. Popular emulators include projects like Higan/bsnes for SNES accuracy, Nestopia for NES games, Genesis Plus GX for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, PCSX-Reloaded for PlayStation titles, and more. It's best to research which emulators are most suitable and accurate for the specific retro console library you want to experience.
### Factors to Consider
When choosing an emulator, consider factors like compatibility, accuracy reproducing the original hardware, feature set like controller support, and system requirements. Low-powered emulators can run on basic computers while more authentic ones demand more processing power. It's a balance of compatibility and accuracy for your needs and hardware.
## Configuring Your Emulator
### Finding and Loading ROM Files
After installing an emulator, the next step is obtaining ROM files, the digital copy of a retro game's software, and loading them into the emulator. ROMs can be found online but downloading copyrighted games without owning the physical media is legally questionable. It's best to only use ROMs of games you already own for personal use.
### Controls, Video, and Audio Settings 
Emulators allow customizing controls, screen resolution, aspect ratio, filtering, sound emulation quality and more. Taking time to configure these optimization settings ensures the best experience mimicking gameplay on the original hardware. Tools like on-screen overlays, cheat codes, and state saving can also enhance emulation.
## Emulator-Specific Tips
### ZSNES vs Higan
ZSNES was one of the early and most full-featured SNES emulators but has issues with accuracy reproducing the console. The newer higan/bsnes project aims for pixel-perfect accuracy at the cost of higher demands on computer hardware. It depends on interests in compatibility vs. authenticity.
## Preserving the Past with Emulation
### Emulation Archives 
Emulation helps preserve classic games, computers, and arcades that may be impossible to use on modern devices otherwise. Projects like Internet Archive have archived thousands of retro software images, manuals, and media for historical preservation through emulation. This ensures future generations can still experience influential titles and systems even after the original hardware is no longer functional.
### Improved Functionality
While striving for accuracy, emulators can also enhance the original experience. Features like save states, rewind, optional filters, widescreen support, and controller upgrades make classic games more accessible than ever before. This keeps niche retro libraries alive and improves how they can be enjoyed decades later.
## Legal Conundrums in Retro Gaming
### Buying ROMs vs Downloading
One legal gray area is obtaining ROM files, as downloading copyrighted games without owning the physical media is legally questionable despite the abandonware arguments. A safer option is only using ROM files of games legally backed up from original owned copies for personal use. However, finding certain out of print ROMs for sale can still be challenging.
## The Future of Retro Gaming Emulation
### Streaming Services and Online Emulation
New options on the horizon include game streaming services with large retro libraries playable online through web browsers. Services like Nintendo Switch Online already offer palettes of classic NES and SNES games. As broadband speeds increase, streaming entire retro consoles could see growth. Online emulators also allow multiplayer retro gaming over the internet. 
### Official Console Emulators 
Expect more first-party retro console emulation from hardware manufacturers in the future. The SNES and NES Nintendo Switch Online apps show a willingness to officially preserve the past. Similar apps on other platforms may emerge especially if publishers see financial opportunities in re-releasing classic catalogs.
