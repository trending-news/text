## Introduction
There are many options available today for retro game fans who want to play their classic collections on a modern HDTV. Whether using original hardware, flash cartridges, or emulation-based systems, each method has its advantages and drawbacks. This guide will compare some of the top retro consoles for NES, SNES, and other 8-bit/16-bit era systems in terms of compatibility, features, cost, and the overall experience they provide.  
### RetroUSB AVS
The RetroUSB AVS is a clone console that uses field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology to closely mimic the original NES hardware. With its ultra-wide compatibility, advanced video options, and support for most accessories, the AVS provides an authentic NES experience on an HDTV. It plays original cartridges as well as flash cartridges containing hundreds of titles. Users can adjust image parameters like scanlines and blur for a truly retro look. The AVS outputs resolutions up to 720p and is highly recommended for NES fans.

### Hi-Def NES Kit 
For original hardware purists, the Hi-Def NES Kit modifies an original NES console to output HDMI video up to 1080p. While requiring soldering skills to install, it preserves the authentic feel of playing on original Nintendo hardware. Options allow upgrading a top-loading NES too. Video quality rivals flashcard systems though not to the level of an FPGA clone. Compatibility is high, though some tweaking may be needed for a few more obscure titles. 
### Hyperkin Retron5
As an affordable multi-system console, the Retron5 plays game cartridges for NES, SNES, Genesis, and more systems except for flashcartridges. It uses emulation for each system so compatibility and performance varies depending on the emulator. Not all accessories are supported and some games may exhibit glitches. However, its $140 price and wide game library make it a good entry point for testing different retro platforms. The user-friendly interface is ideal for casual play.
### Analogue Nt/Nt Mini
For the most authentic original hardware experience, Analogue's Nt and Nt Mini consoles use recreated or harvested chips from the actual NES or Famicom. Video quality and features are unparalleled, with HDMI, save states, region switching and more. Built like a retro console with superior components, they are expensive on the secondary market now. While difficult options to obtain, they remain the gold standard in faithfully replicating the 8-bit era for dedicated collectors.
## Recommended Games for Ports and Remakes
### Mario and Zelda Series Enhancements
Nintendo's legendary Mario and Zelda franchises received excellent portable conversions on the Game Boy Advance. The GBA Mario re-releases like Super Mario Advance offered new gameplay mechanics and graphics over the originals. The Legend of Zelda remakes like The Minish Cap integrated new puzzles and dungeons into the familiar top-down style. Their expansive content and charming 16-bit visuals made these GBA titles standout entries in their respective series.
### Final Fantasy and Pokémon Ports 
Square Enix also supported the GBA well with Final Fantasy re-releases like I-VI. While not entirely faithful to the SNES versions, they were competent JRPGs in their own right with bonus content added. The Pokémon series found a new home on GBA too. Versions like FireRed and LeafGreen added post-game areas and Pokémon not in the original Game Boy titles. Their portability made them addicting revisits for fans of the series' early chapters.
## Comparing Original Hardware to Ports
While GBA ports stayed true to their source material gameplay-wise, playing on original hardware yields a few noticeable differences. Specifically in audio quality, the richer soundtracks of 16-bit consoles are more defined than the GBA's limited speaker. Graphically, pixel art on larger displays possesses a refined clarity not found in portable 240p screens. That said, the ability to take classic adventures anywhere balanced these compromises for Gamboy Advance's massive install base.
## Conclusion
In bringing retro games to modern displays, each presented method carries strengths and drawbacks depending on priority between compatibility, authenticity, features or cost. For faithful replications leveraging original parts, Analogue's consoles are unrivaled but difficult to obtain. The RetroUSB AVS provides an premium NES experience at a lower price. Meanwhile, multi-system solutions offer affordable variety though with tradeoffs. And GBA remains a defining handheld for portable revisits to legendary Nintendo and Square Enix franchises from the 8-bit/16-bit eras. Overall, many excellent options exist for continuing to enjoy vintage classics on HDTVs.
