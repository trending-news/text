## What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to technology that can perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, decision-making, and translation between languages. The overarching goal of AI is to build systems that can solve complex problems and accomplish difficult tasks without human intervention or guidance. 
AI research spans many disciplines, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and more. Machine learning allows systems to learn from large datasets without being programmed. Natural language processing helps computers understand and generate human languages. Computer vision teaches machines to recognize images, videos, and objects. Meanwhile, robotics focuses on creating autonomous machines that can operate in the physical world.
## Types of AI
There are different levels of AI capabilities:
### Reactive Machines 
The simplest form of AI reacts to external stimuli in a predetermined manner with no capacity for learning or problem-solving. Examples include digital assistants that respond to specific keywords.

### Limited Memory AI
These systems can learn by identifying patterns in data and making predictions or recommendations. Examples include spam filters that learn to identify spam email. However, they have no sense of situational awareness or ability to relate memories from different times. 
### Theory of Mind AI 
More advanced AI can model human mental states such as beliefs, desires, intentions, and perspectives. These systems demonstrate an emerging sense of situational awareness allowing them to build social, emotional and conceptual models of different individuals and situations over time.
## Applications of AI 
AI technologies have many real-world applications:
### Machine Learning
Machine learning analyzes vast troves of data to identify patterns and make data-driven predictions or decisions. For instance, machine learning powers predictive analytics for business.
### Natural Language Processing  
NLP technologies like chatbots and voice assistants understand human speech enabling more natural human-computer interactions. NLP also translates between languages and performs tasks like summarization.
### Computer Vision
Computer vision and image recognition are used in security cameras, self-driving cars, medical diagnostics and more to teach machines to visually recognize objects, scenes and activities.
### Robotics
Intelligent robots like self-driving vehicles and industrial robots handle physical processes. Robots are also used for healthcare, education and more.
## Industries impacted by AI
AI is revolutionizing many sectors including:
Healthcare- AI improves drug discovery, assists doctors with diagnostics using medical imaging analysis and more. 
Finance- Fraud detection and risk management using big data analytics helps financial institutions. Robo-advisors also provide personalized investment advice.
Retail- AI improves online shopping via product recommendations and enhances physical stores through demand forecasting and supply chain logistics.
